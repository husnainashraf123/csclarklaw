I bonded out and was supposed to go to court on the 23, for my Denton case, but I got the date mixed up and thought it was on the 28.  My Cameron County lawyers are taking care of my case down there, for which I had my last court appointment today,  and one of them asked a colleague from the Denton area to submit the papers to have my bond reinstated in Denton, but it was denied.  Since my Lawyers aren\\\'t familiar with the Denton courts, I was advised to consult with a local attorney on what they thought would be my best course of actions and for consultation.  I was told the bond is set for 2 cash bonds totaling $22,000.  This is for a misdemeanor 2nd offense and there are two case numbers, Case No. CR-2013-06307-B and Case No. CR-2013-06474-B.  One is for failure to appear to the Arraignment Hearing, and the other is for a no show to the Bond Condition Hearing.  I had gone to see a probation officer back in May, around the time I got arrested for my second offense, who gave me the information needed to get the Interlock device installed in my car, which I did within the time-frame I was given, and have kept up with all of the recalibration services requested since.\r\nWould you be able to help me with this?  Would it be possible to get the bonds reduced?  The fines are at a 3rd offense level, yet, this is my 2nd offense.  If not now, after 30 days?  Is it possible to get the bond reinstated and a new court date?  Should I turn myself in today or would it be okay if I waited until Monday or some other time next week?  (My lease just expired so I would have to move my stuff into a storage unit or renew my lease.  Also, I have to wait for my Mother to drive up from Brownsville, TX, which is 9 hours away, to pick up my pets and car.  She wouldn\\\'t be able to make it until later tonight since she has to work today).\r\nI graduated from UTA in July 2012 with a B.S. in Business Information Systems and I currently have a job as a Search Engine Optimizer agent.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nDaniel Myers\r\n(956) 466-9924', '2013-11-01 16:58:40');

Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2856\" style=\"margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0\" alt=\"about-modern-wordpress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2984\" alt=\"responsive\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2954\" alt=\"colors\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2967\" alt=\"themes\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789\" alt=\"The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7\">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7\">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">on the make/core blog</a>.

For $299/year, <a href=\"http://store.wordpress.com/plans/business/\" target=\"_blank\">Business users</a> get unlimited access to premium themes, unlimited storage, live chat and email support, custom domains, no ads and the newest feature: &#8220;hassle-free&#8221; e-commerce.</p>\n<p>The company opted to offer its new online stores via partnerships with three hosted e-commerce providers: <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/ecwid/\" target=\"_blank\">Ecwid</a>, <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/shopify/\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/shoplocket/\" target=\"_blank\">ShopLocket</a>. Additional and/or monthly fees are also applicable, depending on the store provider selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ecommerce.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17767]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ecommerce.png\" alt=\"ecommerce\" width=\"2424\" height=\"826\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17959\" /></a></p>\n<h3>WordPress.com E-Commerce Excludes Native WordPress Solutions</h3>\n<p>Notably absent from its partners are any native WordPress e-commerce plugins. This isn&#8217;t surprising, given that Automattic has historically favored <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service\" target=\"_blank\">SaaS</a> solutions when it comes to WordPress products.</p>\n<p>The new offering was not without criticism from those who had hoped to see a few of WordPress&#8217; high quality e-commerce plugins thrown into the mix. Commenting on the <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/wordpress-business-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement post</a>, WordPress developer Brent Shepherd <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/wordpress-business-ecommerce/#comment-196231\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s incredibly exciting to see WordPress.com offer eCommerce, but a real shame to see the many excellent open-source options snubbed (including those built specifically for WordPress).</p>\n<p>I understand the many very good reasons why it makes sense to partner with existing hosted services, but I hope that one day, we’ll see WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and other open-source eCommerce options alongside these initial launch partners.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a point of contention for those who would like to see more fluidity for users transitioning between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress installations. A native WordPress e-commerce option might make it easier to transition stores that have outgrown the hosted solution.</p>\n<p>Whereas some have perceived the decision to partner with outside e-commerce providers as an outright snubbing of WordPress&#8217; home grown solutions, the reality is that most WordPress.com users probably don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s under the hood to power their stores. If they did, they would likely be more inclined to go the self-hosted route.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was created to help make the process of setting up and hosting a WordPress blog virtually painless for those who don&#8217;t want to dive into the technical details of setup and maintenance. The e-commerce partners they have selected have a similar audience of sellers who do not wish to be bothered with the technical burden of hosting their own e-commerce installations.</p>\n<h3>The Rising Demand for Hosted E-Commerce</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s $299/year price point is actually quite tempting for those who simply want to marry a hosted WordPress blog to a hosted store under one domain. This product attracts those who prefer to offload the burden of PCI compliance, SSL certificates, payment gateway maintenance and everything else required for selling online.</p>\n<p>Granular control of individual product display is limited to shortcode attributes within the WordPress.com stores, but customers are more than happy to trade deeper level customization for convenience. Aside from slapping a &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; Paypal button on a website, most modern e-commerce implementations require a tech-savvy administrator who isn&#8217;t afraid to tackle a few challenges. A hosted storefront is a more approachable option than the prospect of having to learn everything involved. It&#8217;s also more affordable than hiring a developer.</p>\n<p>Last year we featured <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/cart66-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-for-e-commerce\" target=\"_blank\">Cart66&#8242;s launch</a> as a fully managed WordPress e-commerce platform. With Automattic getting into the game, you know there&#8217;s a clear demand for this. People are looking to seamlessly couple the power of WordPress publishing with an online storefront and they&#8217;re willing to pay for convenience. As more retailers turn to the internet to expand their sales to a global audience, the demand for hosted e-commerce solutions will continue to rise. Any company that can provide a painless experience for customers will take a huge slice of this market.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 00:58:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: How To Redirect Automatic Update Email Notifications In WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17934\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:194:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-redirect-automatic-update-email-notifications-in-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-redirect-automatic-update-email-notifications-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4229:\"<p>One of the biggest features to land in WordPress 3.7 were automatic updates.

Since other events are tied to the email address such as new user registrations, you can&#8217;t substitute the address with your own.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17937\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BackgroundUpdateNotificationEmailAddress1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17934]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17937\" alt=\"Plugin Header\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BackgroundUpdateNotificationEmailAddress1-500x139.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"139\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Plugin Header</p></div>\n<p>A new WordPress plugin called <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-notification-email-address/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/background-update-notification-email-address/\">Background Update Notification Email Address</a> developed by <a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/mustardbees/\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/mustardbees/\">Phil Wylie</a>, <a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/lauravaq/\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/lauravaq/\">Laura Vaquero</a>, and <a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/iwebsolutions/\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/iwebsolutions/\">Interactive Web Solutions</a> solves the problem by changing the email address update notifications are sent to when an automatic background update is completed. By only changing the email address for automatic update notifications, clients are able to continue receiving emails related to administering their website.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17938\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BackgroundUpdateNotificationEmailAddress2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17934]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17938\" alt=\"Where Updates Will Go\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BackgroundUpdateNotificationEmailAddress2-500x178.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"178\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Where Updates Will Go</p></div>\n<p>After activating the plugin, you&#8217;ll find the notification email address located in <strong>Settings > Update Notifications.</strong> Place the email address where update notifications will go into the field, save the changes and wait for a security or maintenance release of WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Filters and Hooks Are A Plugin Authors Best Friend</h3>\n<p>I asked Phil, how was he able to redirect update notifications without affecting the other administrative emails generated by WordPress. I also asked him why they created the plugin. His response:</p>\n<p><em>In terms of how we redirect only the background update emails, WordPress provides us with a handy filter (<code>auto_core_update_email</code> and <code>auto_core_update_send_email</code>) we hook into in order to replace the email address. The filter only fires during an automatic background update and so all other WordPress emails are unaffected.</p>\n<p>Background updates are a valuable feature of WordPress, ensuring sites receive bug/security fixes quickly. There are a number of plugins which control background update behaviour. However, to my knowledge there are no plugins which redirect the email notifications.</em></p>\n<p>Phil suggests if a number of client sites are under your control to create a set of email rules to help organize the notifications.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve got this plugin setup in conjunction with a few email rules. Success notifications are archived and failed updates flagged for manual assessment.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Great Plugin With One Drawback</h3>\n<p>The only drawback I see is the possibility of clients deactivating the plugin, preventing the email from reaching its intended target. Outside of that, this plugin is a neat example of how the presence of filters and hooks in WordPress give plugin authors the opportunity to bend WordPress to their will.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 22:40:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: Better WordPress Security Plugin Gets Major Update To Address Security Vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17946\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:236:\"http://wptavern.com/better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1585:\"<p>Chris Wiegman of iThemes has <a title=\"http://ithemes.com/2014/02/25/better-wp-security-3-x-vulnerability/\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/2014/02/25/better-wp-security-3-x-vulnerability/\">announced</a> the latest update to the <a title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/\">Better WP Security plugin</a> contains fixes for vulnerabilities discovered in 3.6.3.  The updates address compatibility with <a title=\"http://infinitewp.com/\" href=\"http://infinitewp.com/\">InfiniteWP, </a>the removal of their in-dashboard support form, and <a title=\"http://fooplugins.com/\" href=\"http://fooplugins.com/\">FooPlugins</a> support form code.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17949\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BetterWPSecurityScan.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17946]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17949\" alt=\"Better WordPress Security Scan\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BetterWPSecurityScan-500x167.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"167\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Better WordPress Security Scan</p></div>\n<p>While support for InfiniteWP was removed in 3.6.4, it&#8217;s been restored in 3.6.5 as they have since come up with a satisfactory solution eliminating the security risk.

GSoC is a global program that offers promising students an opportunity to contribute code to open source projects with a stipend provided by Google.</p>\n<p>Last year 1,192 students were part of the program. The 2014 program marks the 10th year of GSoC and Google is expecting to sponsor 10% more students than it did in 2013. WordPress is a veteran organization entering its 7th year of participation and is one of <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/list/public/google/gsoc2014\" title=\"GSoC mentoring organizations\" target=\"_blank\">190 mentoring organizations</a> that were selected this year.</p>\n<p>In 2012 WordPress was rejected as a mentoring organization due to a lack of ideas prepared for student projects. However, this year is a different story. The <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014\" target=\"_blank\">GSoC 2014 codex page</a> is brimming with ideas and there are more than 20 potential mentors already on board. Here&#8217;s a quick sampling of some of the ideas put forth for this summer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full-throttle Trac Annihilation</li>\n<li>Forms Plugin</li>\n<li>New BuddyPress Template Pack</li>\n<li>bbPress Per Forum Moderation</li>\n<li>WordCamp Mobile App</li>\n<li>Turn the Beta Testers Plugin into a QA Plugin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What does WordPress hope to gain by participating in the GSoC project? This was one of the questions on the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/13/gsoc-2014-application/\" target=\"_blank\">application</a>, which was submitted by Jen Mylo. <strong>&#8220;It’s a good opportunity to reach students who might not otherwise have considered contributing to WordPress,&#8221;</strong> she said. &#8220;And even if they don’t stick around as frequent contributors, it helps us to evaluate how we ramp up and communicate with new contributors.&#8221; Several participants from prior years of GSoC have gone on to become valuable contributors to WordPress, including Dion Hulse, Daryl Koopersmith and Andrew Nacin, to name just a few.</p>\n<p>Student applications open on March 10th. If you&#8217;re interested to be part of the program, check out the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2014\" target=\"_blank\">GSoC 2014 codex page</a> for information on how to

WordPress theme shops build typography options into their themes, they almost universally opt for integrating <a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts\" target=\"_blank\">Google Fonts</a>. It&#8217;s no wonder, given that Google fonts are free, easy to browse and generally fast-loading.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thethemefoundry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Theme Foundr</a>y is one of the first to step outside the box to integrate commercial fonts into their themes, via a partnership with <a href=\"https://typekit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Typekit</a>. This is the first case of a theme shop selling a self-hosted WordPress theme that includes Typekit fonts right out of the box.</p>\n<p>While other themes may offer support for Typekit, none have included it within the purchase price of the theme until now. Theme Foundry&#8217;s <a href=\"https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/oxford/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford</a> theme is their first product to be bundled with Typekit support.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/oxford.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17813]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/oxford-500x493.jpg\" alt=\"oxford\" width=\"500\" height=\"493\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-17864\" /></a></p>\n<p>I spoke with Drew Strojny, founder of Theme Foundry, to find out why they sought a partnership with Typekit. He said that it was essentially a matter of providing convenience for the customer. &#8220;Asking someone to buy a Typekit subscription to get full value out of their theme isn&#8217;t fair,&#8221; Strojny said. &#8220;So we needed to find a different way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme Foundry plans to roll out Typekit fonts across their entire collection over the next few weeks. Strojny said that Google Fonts, which they previously used, could no longer meet their design standards. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">We pride ourselves on world-class design, and not having access to a library of commercial grade fonts was really holding us back</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Adobe Typekit is the de facto standard for commercial fonts, and we really wanted to keep pushing ahead with better typography and better design.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Strojny would not disclose the details of the partnership with Typekit but said that it&#8217;s &#8220;pretty straightforward and it’s not based on sales or anything like that. Instead, we’re paying for Typekit fonts on behalf of our customers.&#8221; This removes the burden of the customer having to maintain his own subscription with Typekit. Instead, Theme Foundry keeps them on the hook with a $39 annual service fee that will allow the customer to continue to use the fonts.</p>\n<p>The technical challenges of integrating Typekit are invisible to the consumer. &#8220;As a customer, you just authorize using your Theme Foundry account credentials, and your fonts are turned on,&#8221; Strojny explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re using OAuth 2.0 with <a href=\"https://memberful.com\" target=\"_blank\">Memberful</a> and a custom WordPress plugin to handle all the hard stuff.&#8221;  Theme Foundry customers who fail to renew will fall back to a predefined set of defaults.</p>\n<p>Theme Foundry is the first to employ a typography service partnership in order to add value to theme club subscriptions. Whereas a customer may not always opt to renew a theme club membership for the sake of support and updates, the notion of preserving the sophistication of the typography used within the themes may be more compelling.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 23:19:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WordPress.tv: Andrew Nacin: WordPress 3.7: Foundations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=31497\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/26/andrew-nacin-wordpress-3-7-foundations/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:622:\"<div id=\"v-AEEFBxGW-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/31497/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/31497/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=31497&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/26/andrew-nacin-wordpress-3-7-foundations/\"><img alt=\"wceu-ANacin\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/AEEFBxGW/wceu-anacin_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 22:55:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: WordPress Admin Bookmarks: Quickly Access Frequently Edited Pages, Posts or Custom Post Types\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17841\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:246:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-admin-bookmarks-quickly-access-frequently-edited-pages-posts-or-custom-post-types?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-admin-bookmarks-quickly-access-frequently-edited-pages-posts-or-custom-post-types\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3335:\"<p><a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-admin-bookmarks/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-admin-bookmarks/\">Admin Bookmarks</a> developed by <a title=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/bradvin/\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/bradvin/\">Brad Vincent</a>, allows you easily bookmark posts, pages and custom post types.

Jetpack&#8217;s new <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">Related Posts</a> module uses WordPress.com resources to do this instead, which is undoubtedly a huge relief to hosting companies who have had to deal with the negative effects of customers using inefficient plugins.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve turned the module on for the Tavern website, as you can see below this post. When you configure the module, you&#8217;ll be presented with the option of using plain text for the related content or a more visually striking display that includes featured images:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17826\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/configure-related-posts.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17820]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/configure-related-posts.jpg\" alt=\"Configuration options for related posts module\" width=\"1170\" height=\"382\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17826\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Configuration options for related posts module</p></div>\n<h3>Customizing Related Posts</h3>\n<p>Related content is determined based on the content of the post and any tags or categories applied. The module also supports custom post types in that it defaults to posts of the same post type. This can be changed by using the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/blob/05dd3d3922ee9d05d23d1c2a52d36af842c675b6/modules/related-posts/jetpack-related-posts.php#L438\" target=\"_blank\">&#8216;jetpack_relatedposts_filter_post_type&#8217;</a> filter.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can customize this module by creating your own <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/functionality/\" target=\"_blank\">functionality plugin</a>, the preferred method for extending related posts. The Jetpack docs outline several examples for <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/customize-related-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">customizing related content</a> using the available filters. This allows you to easily change the number of related posts, modify where they are displayed, exclude specific posts and more.</p>\n<h3>New Multisite Support</h3>\n<p>Jetpack is now multisite-aware with the added ability to manage all multisite connections in the network admin. Previously, super admins had to manage the connections on an individual site basis, even though Jetpack could be activated network-wide. Network activating Jetpack allows you to administer all your connections from one master account and unlocks a new <strong>Jetpack > Settings</strong> tab in the network admin. This screen allows you to do three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage all your sites&#8217; connections</li>\n<li>Control whether individual site admins can reconnect with their own accounts</li>\n<li>Designate which Jetpack modules are activated by default</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New Options Added to Single Sign On</h3>\n<p>Jetpack 2.9 gives site administrators a new whip to crack in order to ensure a higher level of security. Site admins using the <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/sso/\" target=\"_blank\">Single Sign On module</a> now have the option to require users to have two-step authentication enabled on their WordPress.com account before they are allowed to log in.</p>\n<p>This release also offers new shortcodes and oEmbed capabilities for Mixcloud and Gist content. For a full list of all the enhancements and bug fixes in 2.9, check out the Jetpack <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/\" target=\"_blank\">changelog</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 21:14:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: This Week On WPWeekly: Dre Armeda and Tony Perez of Sucuri Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17773\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:196:\"http://wptavern.com/this-week-on-wpweekly-dre-armeda-and-tony-perez-of-sucuri-security?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=this-week-on-wpweekly-dre-armeda-and-tony-perez-of-sucuri-security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3327:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17773]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png\" alt=\"SucuriLogo\" width=\"100\" height=\"34\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5763\" /></a>Tony Perez and Dre Armeda of <a href=\"http://sucuri.net/\" title=\"http://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri Security</a> will be our special guests on this weeks edition of WordPress Weekly. We&#8217;ll spend the majority of the episode talking about WordPress security and what users can do to protect themselves against the bad guys. We&#8217;ll also figure out why the company was founded and what trends they&#8217;ve noticed over the past year when it comes to attacks on sites powered by WordPress.</p>\n<p>I asked Perez to come up with three areas that website owners need to pay particular attention to. He responded with <strong>access control</strong>, <strong>software vulnerabilities</strong>, and <strong>layered defenses</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Access Control</strong> &#8211; There are two key issues in today&#8217;s attack. Access and vulnerabilities. For the everyday website owner, access is by far the most important to me. We are seeing too many attacks exploiting weak credentials, leaving website owners vulnerable to attacks. It&#8217;s why we continue to see a spike in Brute Force attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Software Vulnerabilities</strong> &#8211; This one isn&#8217;t as actionable as access control for most website owners which is why it&#8217;s second to me. Today&#8217;s website owners are not developers, they are your uncles, moms and dads, starting online businesses or learning to write about their daily experiences. Either way, many are not technical, leaving them susceptible to the world of vulnerabilities. Untrusted sources continue to be leveraged, attackers continue to find ways to circumvent systems in place to keep users safe, and this has the potential to be catastrophic for website owners.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time website owners start looking beyond their existing plugin architectures and start leveraging Software as a Service based services that provide them a perimeter defense, or website firewall. Every network has it, every desktop should have one, and every website will require it in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Layered Defenses</strong> &#8211; We have learned from our desktop and network predecessors, and we do this by thinking in the form of layers. Too many website owners are looking for one solution that will cure all its problems, but the problem is too big for that. They have been putting controls and layers in place that keep them in tune with what is going on with their website. Who is logging in? Who is changing what? Are things changing? Should they be? Website owners have to learn how to administer their website again. This idea of &#8220;<em>set and forget</em>&#8221; is harming us as much as it is helping.</p>\n<h3>Leave Your Questions In The Comments</h3>\n<p>This is a small sample of what we&#8217;ll be discussing this <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly\" title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly\">Friday at 3P.M. Eastern</a>. If you have any questions about Sucuri or WordPress security in general, leave them in the comments and we&#8217;ll ask them near the end of the show.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 19:06:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Profiles On Track to Be Totally Revamped\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17755\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profiles-on-track-to-be-totally-revamped?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-org-profiles-on-track-to-be-totally-revamped\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4365:\"<div id=\"attachment_17801\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profiles-on-track-to-be-totally-revamped/wordpress-swag\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17801\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-swag.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Huasonic - cc\" width=\"1024\" height=\"441\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17801\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/huasonic/3008912290/\">Huasonic</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>WordPress.org profiles are set to get a revamp in the very near future. Jen Mylo <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/25/profiles-how-do-you-use-them-or-want-to/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> yeseterday, asking for thoughts and ideas about what to incorporate into the new profiles. She will be working with Mel Choyce to design a new UI for the profile data.</p>\n<p>Mylo also initiated an <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/23/past-wordcamp-organizers-help/\" target=\"_blank\">effort</a> to get speaker information from past WordCamp organizers as part of the plan is to bring in data from a user&#8217;s involvement in WordPress activities outside of WordPress.org. One of the biggest challenges, however, is ensuring that the profiles will be attractive for all users, including those with very little activity.</p>\n<h3>More User Data to Be Added to the Activity Stream</h3>\n<p>The current profiles on WordPress.org track support forum topics, ideas, and various activities related to Trac. The team plans to add the following additions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>International Forums – new topic or reply (for poster)</li>\n<li>Plugins Directory – released a new plugin (for plugin author)</li>\n<li>Themes Directory – released a new theme (for theme author)</li>\n<li>Make P2s – newly published post (for post author)</li>\n<li>Make P2s – new comment (for commenter)</li>\n<li>Trac – new comment (for commenter)</li>\n<li>Trac – new props (for user getting prop’d)</li>\n<li>WordCamps – new speaker added</li>\n<li>WordCamps – new organizer added</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profiles-on-track-to-be-totally-revamped/profiles-sketch\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17789\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/profiles-sketch-272x300.png\" alt=\"profiles-sketch\" width=\"272\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-17789\" /></a>The updated activity stream should be in place soon. Mylo floated <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/26/profiles-a-sketch/\" target=\"_blank\">a working sketch</a> earlier today to illustrate some of the ideas they&#8217;ve been discussing. She emphasized that the changes to profiles are likely to be added over several iterations.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the team plans to merge the new WordPress.org profiles with the forums profiles, but this will probably be completed further down the road.</p>\n<h3>Your WordPress Resume and Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The feedback on Mylo&#8217;s <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/02/25/profiles-how-do-you-use-them-or-want-to/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> regarding how people use their WordPress.org profiles indicates that contributors want to be able to easily find trac tickets and conversations they&#8217;re involved in. Others commented that contact information and contributions such as plugins and themes are high on the list of items they look for when viewing a person&#8217;s profile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way I’m looking at profiles from a UX perspective is that for a visitor, the profile serves as someone’s WP resume,&#8221; Mylo said. &#8220;While for the profile owner, it serves as the dashboard for their involvement in the open source project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, many people haven&#8217;t bothered to use or update their WordPress.org profiles, perhaps due to the lack of relevant information displayed about user activities. The planned changes will make WordPress.org profiles the go-to place for finding out about someone&#8217;s interactions and contributions to the WordPress project. If you&#8217;re looking to hire a WordPress professional who has a history of contributing back, the new WordPress.org profiles will soon be the best representation of a person&#8217;s involvement with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 17:37:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.tv: Panel: The State of Multilingual WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=31477\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/25/panel-the-state-of-multilingual-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:691:\"<div id=\"v-34ta7rDB-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/31477/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/31477/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=31477&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/25/panel-the-state-of-multilingual-wordpress/\"><img alt=\"wceu &#8211; The State of Multilingual WordPress\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/34ta7rDB/wceu-the-state-of-multilingual-wordpress_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 06:11:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Quickly Navigate The WordPress Backend With WP Hotkeys\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17713\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"http://wptavern.com/quickly-navigate-the-wordpress-backend-with-wp-hotkeys?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=quickly-navigate-the-wordpress-backend-with-wp-hotkeys\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3094:\"<p><a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hotkeys/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hotkeys/\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPHotkeys1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17713]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-17765\" alt=\"WP hot Keys 1\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPHotkeys1.png\" width=\"145\" height=\"140\" /></a>WP Hotkeys</a> is a plugin developed by <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/mcguive7/\">McGuive7</a> and <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/mightyminnow/\">MIGHTYminnow</a> that adds the ability to navigate the backend of WordPress with just a keyboard using shortcuts.

Pressing the wrong key and loading the wrong page induced panic. That&#8217;s when the mouse came in handy to browse back a page.

It will be held Saturday, March 1st, 2014, in Manchester, England from 10:00 &#8211; 18:00. The goal is to have eight solid hours of contributors working together to improve WordPress.</p>\n<p>Jenny Wong, the organizer of the event, regularly attends the WordPress user group in Manchester, which is led by Mike Little. Wong&#8217;s first contributor day experience happened at WordCamp London 2013. She enjoyed it so much that she spoke with Little about hosting a contributor day in Manchester.  He loved idea and the event started to take shape.</p>\n<p>WP Contributor Day will have several experts on hand to help new contributors find their niches. Mike Little will be available to help with core contributions. Graham Armfield will assist with accessibility contributions and Noel Tock will be on hand for BuddyPress. Wong hopes to add more current contributors to help lead groups for the event, ideally, those who have experience contributing in themes, plugins, support and documentation.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;My hope is to remove the fear for newcomers who want to take the plunge to contribute to the WordPress project,&#8221;</strong> Wong said, explaining her vision for the event. She hopes that the experience will help new contributors to gain confidence in contributing back to the project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For current contributors, I hope the event allows them to take a block of time from their busy lives and concentrate on one task,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I know from personal experience it sometimes takes an event for you to book time to do something you have been meaning to do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They aim to keep the first Manchester Contributor Day event simple and learn from it before planning more. Wong hopes that in the future other WordPress user groups will set up their own contributor days and she is happy to promote them all on the WP Contributor Day site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be super cool to have them on the same day / week to make it a global event similar to Start Up Weekend,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But that involves a lot of logistics.

It ships with everything you need to get a local install of WordPress up and running. Apache, PHP, MySQL, and WordPress 3.6 are prepackaged.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering why WordPress 3.6 is installed and not the latest version. Seamus Brady, developer of InstantWP, told me he keeps it a few versions behind since people use it to test upgrades. Upgrading to the latest version is accomplished from the backend of WordPress.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17650\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InstantWPControlPanel.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17514]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17650\" alt=\"Control Panel After Installation\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InstantWPControlPanel-500x294.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"294\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Control Panel After Installation</p></div>\n<p>While InstantWP is compatible with Windows based machines, it doesn&#8217;t work on Macs and doesn&#8217;t support WordPress multisite. However, the software is portable as you can install and run it from a USB thumbdrive. I use <a title=\"http://www.wampserver.com/en/\" href=\"http://www.wampserver.com/en/\">WampServer</a> to handle my local WordPress install but InstantWP was faster to use. I didn&#8217;t have to create a database, administrator account or password. You can only run one instance of the software at a time. Creating a second test site is as simple as installing InstantWP into a different folder.</p>\n<p>It also comes with a set of demo content that comes in handy for testing plugins and themes.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17659\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InstantWPTestSite.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17514]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17659\" alt=\"Dummy Content Already In Place\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/InstantWPTestSite-500x401.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"401\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dummy Content Already In Place</p></div>\n<p>Don&#8217;t mind the WordPress fauxgo in the dummy content.

This information is not easy to find, as it&#8217;s tucked away under the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Help:Editing\" target=\"_blank\">Editing Help</a> page in the codex.</p>\n<p>Although the WordPress editor doesn&#8217;t show subscript and superscript buttons, you can add these characters anytime using the sub or sup tags. For example, to display H<sub>2</sub>0, you would write it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0</pre>\n<p>Superscript characters can be added like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">My reference&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;</pre>\n<p>That above example would display: My reference<sup>1</sup></p>\n<h3>Add Subscript and Superscript Buttons to the Visual Editor</h3>\n<p>There are many TinyMCE buttons that are disabled by default so as not to clutter up the WordPress editor with buttons that most people rarely use. If you find that you often need to add characters above or below the normal line of type, you may want to consider adding the Subscript and Superscript buttons to the visual editor for your own convenience.</p>\n<p>The WordPress codex section on <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/TinyMCE_Custom_Buttons#Enabling_hidden_MCE_buttons\" target=\"_blank\">enabling hidden MCE buttons</a>, which demonstrates how to filter the button list.  You can create a quick functionality plugin using the snippet below:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function my_mce_buttons_2($buttons) {	\n	/**\n	 * Add in a core button that\'s disabled by default\n	 */\n	$buttons[] = \'sup\';\n	$buttons[] = \'sub\';\n\n	return $buttons;\n}\nadd_filter(\'mce_buttons_2\', \'my_mce_buttons_2\');</pre>\n<p>Filtering mce_buttons_2 will add the buttons to the second line in the visual editor. Filtering mce_buttons_3 will display the added buttons on a third line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-add-subscript-and-superscript-characters-in-wordpress/new-buttons\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17733\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/new-buttons.png\" alt=\"new-buttons\" width=\"1309\" height=\"217\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17733\" /></a></p>\n<p>For more technical writing that goes beyond basic subscript and superscript characters, you may need to employ an additional tool such as the open source <a href=\"http://www.latex-project.org/guides/\" target=\"_blank\">LaTeX</a> typesetting system. LaTeX makes it possible to post complex scientific and mathematical equations.

The theme <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/tuned-balloon-yumblog-lens-hexa-singl-hm-magazine/\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> last week on WordPress.com and hit WordPress.org over the weekend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hexa-a-free-colorful-wordpress-theme-highlighting-post-formats/hexa\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17642\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17642\" alt=\"hexa\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hexa.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p>Named for the geometric shapes used throughout the theme, Hexa connects each post to the next with a colorful line extending from the hexagonal icon designated for each. This bright, geometric design is perfect for crystallizing your thoughts into structured posts.</p>\n<h3>Big Featured Images</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hexa-a-free-colorful-wordpress-theme-highlighting-post-formats/hexa-featured\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17678\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-17678\" alt=\"hexa-featured\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hexa-featured.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\" /></a>One of the distinguishing features of this design is the large (842 pixels wide) featured image area above posts, as seen on the index and archive pages.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re switching to Hexa, appropriately-sized featured images are something important to consider. However, you can always <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/\" target=\"_blank\">regenerate thumbnails</a>.</p>\n<h3>Hidden Extras</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/hexa-a-free-colorful-wordpress-theme-highlighting-post-formats/widget-areas\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17681\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-17681\" alt=\"widget-areas\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/widget-areas-300x238.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"238\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hexa keeps its three widget areas neatly out of sight with a unique pull down section, activated by the corresponding icon in the header.</p>\n<p>The icon menu in the header also pulls down a hidden search bar, navigation and social icons. Anything peripheral to the content is kept out of sight unless opened by the visitor.</p>\n<h3>Custom Header, Background and Menu</h3>\n<p>Hexa&#8217;s customization options are built into WordPress&#8217; native customizer. You can add your own header or background image.

In that world any company (including <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>) that generally eschews hype, is largely subscription driven, and has a small number of employees relative to its audience should be thrilled at the <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/02/19/facebook-price-for-having-no-phone-os-19-billion-a-must-have-apps-play-priceless/\">19 billion dollar acquisition of WhatsApp</a>. The deal is incredible.</p>\n<p>This has kicked off another round of pattern matching and <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/14299211\">halo effects</a>, which are currently incredibly favorable but will evolve over the coming years based on how things go post-integration, just like the public perceptions of Geocities, Youtube, Doubleclick, Bebo, and Skype wildly shifted based largely on the press coverage over their latest traded value.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m thrilled with the outcome for <a href=\"http://www.whatsapp.com/\">WhatsApp</a> and the manner in which they built their company, their product, and I hope they bring more of that thinking to Facebook, but I don&#8217;t think they should become a playbook any more than Instagram should inspire a no-revenue playbook. The pattern we should take away from this story is that <strong>there is no pattern</strong>. (In Perl, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.perl.com/pub/1999/03/pm.html\">there&#8217;s more than one way to do it</a>&#8221; or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There\'s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it\">Tim Toady</a>.) As an entrepreneur making decisions for your company, always go back to your first principles of what&#8217;s important to you and why you started in the first place. As a journalist, try not to fit everyone into arcs you&#8217;ve seen before or ascribe value to previous coverage (or lack of coverage). As an investor try to evaluate every situation on its unique merits. Should founders be CEOs or not? Well, it depends on the founders, the company, and what it means to be CEO, not what an over-normalized sample of a few hundred companies did before in completely different contexts.</p>\n<p>There are also products that succeed with design that seems childish or terrible on the surface (Myspace, eBay, Snapchat). A lot of what it comes down to is <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/good.html\">have you made something people want</a>, and are they finding out about it from their friends. That&#8217;s often the realm people think of as marketing. The best marketers in the world don&#8217;t fit our preconceptions of what that word means because they&#8217;re in hoodies instead of suits and create environments and ecosystems rather than the traditional trappings of marketing.</p>\n<p><ins datetime=\"2014-02-24T19:09:19+00:00\">Update: From <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dsa\">@dsa</a>, here&#8217;s a great follow-up read on Techcrunch: <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/02/flappy-bird-patterns-and-context/\">What Games Are: Flappy Bird, Patterns, And Context</a>.</ins></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 17:52:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Graph Paper Press Offers Customers WordPress Child Theme Generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://wptavern.com?p=17549&preview_id=17549\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:196:\"http://wptavern.com/graph-paper-press-offers-customers-wordpress-child-theme-generator?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=graph-paper-press-offers-customers-wordpress-child-theme-generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4700:\"<p>A child theme is defined in the <a title=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\" href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes\">WordPress codex</a> as a theme that inherits the functionality of another theme, called the parent theme.

A child theme is the safest and easiest way to modify an existing theme, whether you want to make a few tiny changes or extensive changes. Instead of modifying the theme files directly, you can create a child theme and override within.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17585\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ChildThemeGeneratorFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17549]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17585\" alt=\"Child theme Generator Featured Image\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ChildThemeGeneratorFeaturedImage-500x189.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"189\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tambako/3103173930/\">Tambako the Jaguar</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Graph Paper Press has created a WordPress <a title=\"https://graphpaperpress.com/blog/wordpress-child-theme-generator-intro/\" href=\"https://graphpaperpress.com/blog/wordpress-child-theme-generator-intro/\">child theme generator</a> for their customers. Unfortunately, too many people make changes to their theme without using the child theme technique. If the theme is upgraded, the changes are usually lost. Graph Paper Press has an excellent explanation on why using child themes is important.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But Jake had spent hours and hours customizing the theme he downloaded and upgrading to the latest version would wipe out all of his changes.</p>\n<p>Jake was stuck. He could either upgrade his theme to the new version so he could take advantage of all the new features or stick with his older customized version. That’s not a place we want anyone to be in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of theme companies provide documentation explaining to customers how to create a child theme. Graph Paper Press on the other hand is the first company I&#8217;ve seen create a generator for their customers to use. This greatly decreases the chance a customer will create the child theme in the wrong way or place the files in the wrong location.</p>\n<p>To use <a title=\"http://graphpaperpress.com/wordpress-child-theme-generator/\" href=\"http://graphpaperpress.com/wordpress-child-theme-generator/\">the generator</a>, customers put the child theme name into the appropriate field and then select the parent theme. The advanced options show fields to add an author name, author URI, and a description. Once the fields have been filled, click the generate button. This produces a zip file to download.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17584\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GraphPaperPressGenerator1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17549]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17584\" alt=\"Step One Of The Generator\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GraphPaperPressGenerator1-500x282.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Step One Of The Generator</p></div>\n<p>The zip file contains a properly formatted <strong>style.css</strong> and <strong>functions.php</strong> file based on the names provided in the generator. CSS code added to the style.css file will override any styles defined within the parent theme. You can also add template files from the parent theme such as <strong>home.php</strong> and tweak them to your liking. Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the changes, upload and activate the theme in WordPress as you would with any other theme.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning Of A Trend?</h3>\n<p>Child themes are an easy way to make changes to themes without having to worry them being lost if the parent theme needs to be upgraded. They&#8217;re also a great way to organize changes made to a parent theme. This is a great move by Graph Paper Press and is something I&#8217;d like to see become standard with other commercial theme shops.</p>\n<p>Child plugins work on the same concept but are created and implemented differently. <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-extend-a-wordpress-plugin-without-losing-your-changes\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-extend-a-wordpress-plugin-without-losing-your-changes\">Read our guide</a> to learn how to create a child plugin.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know of other commercial WordPress theme companies that offer their customers a child theme generator?

By integrating these two technologies, the editor resembles an environment coders will be familiar with.</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed when writing my first post with the plugin enabled was the inability to use the <strong>TAB key</strong> to move to the next line. I had to manually click inside the editor window to begin writing my post. I found out this plugin only manipulates the Text or HTML version of the editor. At first, I thought the editor-style.css file that&#8217;s part of Stargazer was overriding WP Post Editor. However, after I switched themes, I determined WP Editor doesn&#8217;t alter the Visual editor in any way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17591\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17522]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17591\" alt=\"WordPress Text Editor Using Lesser Dark Theme\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor1-500x169.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"169\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress Text Editor Using Lesser Dark Theme</p></div>\n<p>The settings page contains five different sections: <strong>Main settings, Theme Editor, Plugin Editor, Post Editor, and Overview</strong>. They&#8217;re self-explanatory but you&#8217;ll want to visit the main settings page first. By default, WP Post Editor hides the WordPress version of the theme and plugin editor links and will load the WP Editor version of the theme and plugin editors. You can turn them back on from the main settings page.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17592\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17522]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17592\" alt=\"WP Post Editor Main Settings\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor2-500x364.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WP Post Editor Main Settings</p></div>\n<p>WP Post Editor ships with twelve different themes. I&#8217;ve been looking for a way to darken the post editor and this plugin accomplishes that by offering twelve different themes. The downside to using this plugin is that each registered user who has access to the post editor will see the WP Post Editor version. It would be great if the editor and themes could be tied to users, perhaps through their profile. Also, depending on the post editor theme selected, some colors are hard to see.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17593\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor3.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17522]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17593\" alt=\"Some Colors Hard To See \" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor3-500x259.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"259\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some Colors Hard To See</p></div>\n<p>The strength of this plugin lies within the plugin and theme editors. WP Post Editor has built-in support for file uploading. This is a killer feature because it enables files to be uploaded without the use of FTP. Uploading files is quick and painless. The code within the editor is a step up from what WordPress offers out of the box. It&#8217;s color coded and features line numbers. You can also download the file or the entire plugin from within the editor.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17594\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor4.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17522]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17594\" alt=\"WP Editor Version Of The Plugin Editor\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPPostEditor4-500x211.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"211\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WP Editor Version Of The Plugin Editor</p></div>\n<h3>Nice Plugin But Doesn&#8217;t Solve My Problem</h3>\n<p>Overall, WP Editor is a neat plugin containing a myriad of options to change the look and feel of each editor in WordPress.

2.0, due sometime in mid-April, officially <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-development-kicks-off-today-release-set-for-mid-april\" target=\"_blank\">kicked off development</a> a couple weeks ago. This release will include some exciting, visible new features, including the ability to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-0-to-add-profile-editing-in-the-wordpress-admin\" target=\"_blank\">edit BuddyPress profiles in the WordPress admin</a>. But there are also some major improvements happening under the hood that will help BuddyPress to scale better in the near future.</p>\n<p>Moving the user &#8216;last_activity&#8217; data out of the wp_usermeta table has been a on the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0\">roadmap</a> for awhile, but what does that really mean and who will it affect?</p>\n<p>The &#8216;last_activity&#8217; data is what you see displayed on user profiles:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/big-performance-improvements-coming-to-buddypress-2-0/last-active\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17575\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/last-active.jpg\" alt=\"last-active\" width=\"543\" height=\"330\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17575\" /></a></p>\n<p>This data is also used within BuddyPress to sort results and to determine whether a user is a valid site member. In an <a href=\"http://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/user-last_activity-data-and-buddypress-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> last week, BuddyPress core developer Boone Gorges explained why the issue has developed into what he calls &#8220;a perennial performance bottleneck&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the case of users, the information was stored in wp_usermeta. This table gets exceptionally bloated on busy sites, and it’s not properly indexed for the sorts of ORDER BY queries we were performing on it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gorges put <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/7860\" target=\"_blank\">a fix</a> in place to address the issue. BuddyPress 2.0 will now store user last_activity data in its own row within the wp_bp_activity table, even if the site has the Activity component disabled. <strong>&#8220;The performance improvements are pretty extreme,&#8221;</strong> Gorges said and promised to post benchmarks as development for BuddyPress 2.0 approaches release.</p>\n<p>When applying the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5128#comment:7\" target=\"_blank\">first patch</a> to the issue, Gorges shared a few preliminary metrics that should give you an idea of the performance improvements in this fix:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Basically, the main query went from about 57ms to .3ms. Roughly two orders of magnitude improvement. This will become more dramatic on larger sites (usermeta&#8217;s performance will degrade in a greater-than-linear fashion), especially where usermeta is filled with lots of other junk from other plugins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8216;Last_activty&#8217; data will be indefinitely mirrored in both the old and new locations in order to maintain backwards compatibility with plugins. However, plugin authors are encouraged to update their extensions to get data via the BuddyPress API functions instead of the old method. Gorges offers an example in his <a href=\"http://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/user-last_activity-data-and-buddypress-2-0/\" target=\"_blank\">update</a> and lists a few plugins from the WordPress Plugin Directory that will need to be updated.</p>\n<p>Plugin developers who want to take advantage of these performance improvements have plenty of time to prepare an updated version to have on deck to coincide with the 2.0 release.

this episode, <a title=\"http://www.marcuscouch.com/\" href=\"http://www.marcuscouch.com/\">Marcus Couch</a> and I sat down with Chris Wallace, co-founder of <a title=\"https://upthemes.com\" href=\"https://upthemes.com\">UpThemes</a> and discussed in detail the reasons behind the <a title=\"https://upthemes.com/open-letter/\" href=\"https://upthemes.com/open-letter/\">open letter</a> published by the company. We learned how Chris got involved with WordPress theme development and the circumstances leading to the creation of UpThemes.</p>\n<p>Chris explained how hard it was to make a profit on commercial themes and how early development decisions played a large role in revenue disappearing nearly causing the company to fail. Last but not least, we talked about the trend of theme shops simplifying their products while relying on plugins to provide specific functionality.</p>\n<p>Near the end of the interview, Chris gave us a heads up on a new product they are working on called <a title=\"http://issuepress.co/\" href=\"http://issuepress.co/\">IssuePress</a>. It enables developers to use the Github repository issue tracker to provide support.</p>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a title=\"http://wptavern.com/duo-security-plugin-vulnerability-affecting-a-subset-of-wordpress-multisite-networks\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/duo-security-plugin-vulnerability-affecting-a-subset-of-wordpress-multisite-networks\">Duo Security Plugin Vulnerability Affecting A Subset Of WordPress Multisite Networks</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/aesop-story-engine-now-available-on-wordpress-org\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/aesop-story-engine-now-available-on-wordpress-org\">Aesop Story Engine Now Available On WordPress.org</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/tips-for-promoting-newly-released-wordpress-plugins\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/tips-for-promoting-newly-released-wordpress-plugins\">Tips For Promoting Newly Released WordPress Plugins</a><br />\n<a title=\"http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org\">“Adopt-Me” Plugin Tag Is Now in Use in the WordPress Plugin Directory</a></p>\n<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>\n<p><a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pipes/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pipes/\">WP Pipes</a> makes a similar WordPress based “service” just like Yahoo Pipes!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are things you can do with WP Pipes (just like Yahoo Pipes):</li>\n<li>Get Posts from WordPress Posts &gt; Export as RSS Feed</li>\n<li>Get Posts from WordPress Posts &gt; Export as iTunes Podcast</li>\n<li>Get Posts from WordPress Posts &gt; Export as Google XML Sitemap</li>\n<li>Get Documents from WordPress &gt; Export to Google Drive</li>\n<li>Get WooCommerce Products &gt; Export as RSS Feed or Google XML Sitemap</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-construction-mode/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-construction-mode/\">WP Construction Mode</a> can set the entire website or specific pages under construction or maintenance.

They&#8217;re usually only generated for an important notice, or when an action is required on your part. However, there are a few different circumstances under which you may not want WordPress to send any emails.</p>\n<p>For example, when working on a development site, or even a production site, you may inadvertently trigger emails that send to real users when testing or making changes.</p>\n<p>The best developers are able to stay invisible. Ideally, you don&#8217;t want any users to know or suspect that you are working on the site, so it&#8217;s important to suppress emails that might be triggered by your work. Fortunately, there are two plugins that will do this for you automatically.</p>\n<h3>Stop Emails</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/stop-emails/\" target=\"_blank\">Stop Emails</a> plugin, created by Sal Ferrarello, works silently to prevent any outgoing emails from being sent using wp_mail() function. WordPress will continue to act normally, as if the emails were sent successfully.</p>\n<p>When the plugin is active, you&#8217;ll see a notice in the admin area to remind you that emails are not currently being sent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-stop-wordpress-from-sending-emails/no-emails-notice\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17557\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/no-emails-notice.png\" alt=\"no-emails-notice\" width=\"995\" height=\"113\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17557\" /></a></p>\n<p>Stop Emails also has a filter that you can use, which will allow you to log emails and send the information to the php_error.log:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">add_filter(\'fe_stop_emails_log_email\', \'__return_true\');</pre>\n<h3>Disable Emails</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-emails/\" target=\"_blank\">Disable Emails</a> is a similar plugin, created by WordPress plugin developer Ross McKay. It stops any and all emails, using the standard <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail\" target=\"_blank\">wp_mail()</a> function by replacing it with an empty function. Disable Emails is different in that it is totally silent and does not show an admin notice to remind you that emails are stopped.</p>\n<p>It also has a more explanatory readme.txt file that cites several scenarios wherein you might consider shutting WordPress emails off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstration websites that allow users to do things that normally send emails</li>\n<li>Development / test websites with live data that might email real customers</li>\n<li>Bulk-loading data into websites which might trigger emails</li>\n<li>Adding new sites into multisite installations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of these plugins are aimed at developers who probably want to turn emails off temporarily or only on a development site. You could also use the plugin to create a totally silent WordPress site that never sends out any notifications, although this is probably not recommended.</p>\n<p>Email notifications are still one of the easiest ways to keep your finger on the pulse of your website when you don&#8217;t visit every day. If you opt to use one of these plugins temporarily on a live site, it&#8217;s important to remember to turn the plugin off when you&#8217;re finished working.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 12:03:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: “Adopt-Me” Plugin Tag Is Now in Use in the WordPress Plugin Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17499\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:164:\"http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4526:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/adopt-me-plugin-tag-is-now-in-use-on-wordpress-org/adopt-me-yellow\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17539\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adopt-me-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"adopt-me-yellow\" width=\"700\" height=\"167\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17539\" /></a></p>\n<p>Recently we explored the question of whether or not a clear path for WordPress.org plugin adoption could help to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/could-wordpress-plugin-adoption-lower-the-rate-of-abandonment\" target=\"_blank\">lower the rate of abandonment</a>. Some have suggested that having a standard (unofficial) adoption tag might help to bring more exposure to plugins that need a new owner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adopt-Me&#8221; was suggested as one possible tag for developers to use to identify plugins that they would prefer to adopt out rather than abandon. WordPress developer <a href=\"http://www.foellmann.de/christian/\">Christian Foellmann</a> is the first to make use of the tag. If you visit the &#8220;<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/adopt-me\" target=\"_blank\">adopt-me</a>&#8221; plugin tag page, you&#8217;ll find his <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-mu/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics MU</a> plugin available for adoption.</p>\n<p>Foellmann put his plugin up for adoption because he was no longer able to provide adequate support for it. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">I really believe that you have to &#8216;choose your battles&#8217; when it comes to open source contribution</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You need to make sure that you do not stretch yourself too thin. So I finally realized that I can only support a plugin (project) properly if I deploy it myself.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Free to a Good Home&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Foellmann has a rather unique reason for wanting to find the plugin a new home. &#8220;I run all my sites in multisite installations so the tracking of a complete network is something really appealing at first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Until you realize the implications of EU and especially German privacy law. When it comes to user tracking the functionality of the plugin can get you into hot water &#8211; fast.&#8221; It&#8217;s for this reason that he&#8217;s decided to remove the plugin from his toolbox.</p>\n<p>Already on the lookout for a best practice for plugin adoption, Foellmann saw our recent <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/could-wordpress-plugin-adoption-lower-the-rate-of-abandonment\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> and decided to be the first to use the &#8220;adopt-me&#8221; tag in hopes of keeping his plugin alive. He said that the ideal new owner would be a current user who is wiling to keep development open on Github. Foellmann will happily transfer over the Github repo.</p>\n<h3>Will the &#8220;Adopt-Me&#8221; tag take off?</h3>\n<p>The &#8220;adopt-me&#8221; tag will never catch on if nobody knows about it. Though the tag is technically unofficial, it will require developers to use it and recommend it, if there&#8217;s any possibility of it becoming a useful designation on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>When I discussed the matter of an unofficial tag with Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood in a previous conversation, he had little hope of it gaining any traction. His thoughts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I don’t think it will take off because it’s edge-casey and relies on authors giving away their plugins intentionally instead of simply letting them die from neglect.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His assessment would indicate that most developers who abandon their plugins are likely not motivated enough to put their extensions on the path to adoption, even if there is a known tag.</p>\n<p>Foellmann has more hope for his <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-mu/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics MU</a> plugin, which is actually a fork of a plugin that he originally tried to adopt. Since there was no process at the time and the plugin&#8217;s author was unreachable, he was forced to fork the original plugin.</p>\n<p>This type of situation may be a contributing factor to the repository having so many plugins which seem to perform the same function. No path for adoption makes it easier to fork an existing work to make small changes or updates.</p>\n<p>When I asked Foellmann if he thinks the &#8220;adopt-me&#8221; tag will take off, he said, &#8220;I really hope so. It might reduce the number of corpses rotting away in the repo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Is anyone else planning on making use of the tag?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 01:57:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WordPress.tv: Stefan Kanev: Test-Driven Development And Refactoring\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=30753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/20/stefan-kanev-test-driven-development-and-refactoring/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:689:\"<div id=\"v-m7MbpFrF-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/30753/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/30753/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=30753&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/20/stefan-kanev-test-driven-development-and-refactoring/\"><img alt=\"Stefan Kanev: Test-Driven Development And Refactoring\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/m7MbpFrF/video-c99f0d694b_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 23:53:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: Bob Dunn Launches New WordPress Learning Site\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17444\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:154:\"http://wptavern.com/bob-dunn-launches-new-wordpress-learning-site?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bob-dunn-launches-new-wordpress-learning-site\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9522:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BobDunn.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17444]\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-17504\" alt=\"Bob Dunn\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BobDunn-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Bob Dunn, who&#8217;s been teaching WordPress for years, has launched an <a title=\"http://bobwptutorials.com/\" href=\"http://bobwptutorials.com/\">all new website</a> dedicated to helping people learn WordPress. The new site is filled with tutorials, up to date information about WordPress, and in the near future, complimentary eBooks. I got in touch with Bob and asked him a few questions about the new site.</p>\n<p><strong>How will Bobwptutorials differentiate itself from other WordPress learning sites?</strong></p>\n<p>When I was thinking about what this new service might look like, I kept hearing the voices of the thousands of people I have trained. They shared their frustrations with listening to audio without the visual references they needed. Some of them had tried other video tutorials but couldn&#8217;t keep up and absorb the information because the trainer&#8217;s pace was too fast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BobWPTutorialsFrontpage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17444]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-17502\" alt=\"Landing Page For BobWPTutorials\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BobWPTutorialsFrontpage-500x114.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"114\" /></a></p>\n<p>Everyone learns differently and people need to find the instructional style that works best for them. My teaching style is different from other WordPress trainers. My tutorials are less formal, less scripted and more like I am having a conversation with my students. I give them a little more time to take in the information so it makes more sense. I provide screenshots as well, so students who learn better through visual styles can get what they need. That&#8217;s not everyone&#8217;s style of learning, but some people are naturally drawn to my approach.</p>\n<p>But what really sets <a title=\"http://bobwptutorials.com\" href=\"http://bobwptutorials.com\">BobWPTutorials</a> apart from the others is that I have a deep focus on two themes, <strong>Genesis Child Themes</strong> and <strong>WooThemes</strong> so members can explore the themes thoroughly and figure out what they need upfront, before they make a purchase. This has been a recurring issue with people who have come to me after having a bad experience. They have bought a theme and now they find it isn&#8217;t the one that will work best for their needs.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17506\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FreeVideosOffered.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17444]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17506\" alt=\"A Sample Of The Free Videos Available\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/FreeVideosOffered-500x257.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"257\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Sample Of The Free Videos Available</p></div>\n<p>So I wanted to hit that pain point. For each theme, members get an overview tutorial that lets them know what they can and cannot do with it out-of-the-box, without customizations. (<em>Because most people who work with me fear code.</em>) One of the hardest things for users to do is to visualize what their site might look like by just looking at the theme demo. The second video helps members set up their chosen theme step by step, primarily that all-important home page. In this second video, I also give them other setup options, so they understand they are not stuck with the exact look of the theme provider&#8217;s demo.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I have added <strong>Video Highlights</strong>. This is a separate text and screenshot instruction that goes over the major points of the video. This way a member can revisit the important details without having to watch the entire video again.</p>\n<p><strong>Based on your experience, what is the most common area of WordPress people struggle with?</strong></p>\n<p>Wow, where do I start? I think in a general sense, it’s the non-intuitiveness of the interface. Lots of smart people get lost there and some of the simplest features are well-hidden. One example: During a training session, I shared how to expand the editor window by dragging the edged corner. You cannot imagine how many “<em>ah-ha&#8217;s</em>&#8221; I heard in the audience. One person even shared that they had been frustrated by that for six months.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_17508\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WordPressThemeRepositoryThemeCount.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17444]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-17508\" alt=\"Lots Of Themes To Choose From\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WordPressThemeRepositoryThemeCount-500x130.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"130\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lots Of Themes To Choose From</p></div>\n<p>Another thing people struggle with is theme choice. I know several WordPress people who say “<em>just grab one and start with it</em>”. But I have seen too many people struggle because they hadn’t thought through what they need their theme to do. Some will wallow in the sea of themes for months, frustrated and still not finding what they are looking for.</p>\n<p>Those are just two of the areas users struggle with. It really depends on the person and their comfort level with technology. I know some very smart people who have Masters and Doctorates, but, still, they find it all very confusing.</p>\n<p><strong>On average, what demographic represents the majority of your customers?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s all over the board, but my one-on-one training is skewed toward the 40+ crowd. If I had to choose, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s stronger on the female side. Often, they are people who are at a certain age and changing careers, starting a new business, stepping into the world of technology, or wanting to grow their hobby or interest. A lot of people in that age bracket feel they have been left behind by technology. I tend to attract them probably because of my age and my patience, maybe. You need to be a very patient person to be a WordPress trainer.</p>\n<p>I have dealt with all ages, skill levels, genders and ethnic backgrounds. I’m a pretty laid-back guy with an open mind and a love for people.</p>\n<p><strong>WordPress is an ever-evolving piece of software. Are you finding it harder or easier to explain how it works to new users?</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true, it keeps me on the ball, keeping up with the changes and communicating them to my clients. But I wouldn’t say it’s any harder to explain as time passes. It can always be a challenge to teach an old dog a new trick. But it&#8217;s also what I love about my job. Constantly learning new things and finding ways to make the new and difficult easy for the next person to understand. I love that things change and evolve.</p>\n<p><strong>Out of curiosity, what membership plugin are you using for Bobwptutorials and why did you choose it over others?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m using <a title=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\">Woo Commerce</a> and a combination of extensions, including <a title=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/groups-woocommerce/\" href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/groups-woocommerce/\">Groups</a> and <a title=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/\" href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/\">Subscriptions</a>. My choice had a lot to do with my history with WooThemes, and, yes, Genesis child themes. With my personal training and Bobwptutorials, I focus on Genesis child themes and WooThemes. Why? Because I have used them both since I started with WordPress back in 2008 and I know and trust them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WooCommerceGrey.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17444]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-17507\" alt=\"Woo Commerce Grey\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WooCommerceGrey-500x125.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"125\" /></a></p>\n<p>My site <a title=\"http://bobwp.com\" href=\"http://bobwp.com\">bobwp.com</a> is built on a Genesis child theme, so I wanted to make my second site with a WooTheme, you know, to share the love. When I first came up with the idea of this site, I contacted Matt at WooThemes, laid it out and said, can I make this work with a WooTheme and WooCommerce (<em>the latter of which I already had some experience with</em>)? He said yes, so that decided that. I love things that are simple, and if I can use something I already know well, I’m on it. I have tried a couple of membership plugins in the past on other sites, some I like, some not so much. But I can say there are some really good membership plugins out there. This was just the best route for me to go for this site.</p>\n<h3>Bob Is The Man</h3>\n<p>Be sure to check out the four free videos he&#8217;s made available.

This set of tools was created to make it easy for WordPress theme and plugin developers to add options to their projects. This first release contains more than 20 options, including meta boxes, Google font selector, a media uploader, multicheck categories and taxonomies, theme customizer options and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.titanframework.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Titan</a> claims to be the easiest options framework you&#8217;ll ever use. With just a few simple lines of code you can quickly add customization options that are easy for clients to use and understand. For example, to get an instance of the Titan Framework for your plugin, you&#8217;d add just one line to the the main plugin file:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">$titan = TitanFramework::getInstance( \'my-plugin\' );</pre>\n<p>Setting up an admin page and menu for your options is as easy as adding a couple lines of code:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">$panel = $titan-&gt;createAdminPanel( array(\n    name =&gt; \'Theme Options\',\n) );</pre>\n<p>This helps to keep your code clean with the Titan engine powering the details related to building options.</p>\n<h3>The Titan Framework Was Built For Efficiency</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/speed-up-wordpress-development-with-the-titan-framework/me2\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17477\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/me2.jpg\" alt=\"me2\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-17477\" /></a>I had the chance to speak with <a href=\"http://www.gambit.ph/\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Intal</a>, Titan Framework&#8217;s creator, to ask him why he decided to put another WordPress options framework out into the wild, despite the fact that there are already so many. Intal said that Titan resulted from a bit of spring cleaning he completed on his themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I started creating WordPress themes 4 years ago, as my number of projects grew, I had a hard time managing all the code from the different themes I had,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By instinct, I started unifying all the similar code to make things more manageable. After months of work, I ended up with a huge framework that handled everything the theme needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From there his private framework evolved as he learned more about WordPress best practices. Intal began removing much of the functionality and turning it into plugins:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My mindset was that every feature should be included with the theme. As I learned more and more about the ins and outs of WordPress, I learned that what I did was a big no no. So now, I&#8217;m dissecting those themes, and turning its innards into plugins. One of those is the Titan Framework.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Intal&#8217;s spring cleaning resulted in a powerful set of options that speed up development. He uses it regularly in client projects. In one example he needed to provide information on various locations on a map, so he created a custom post type for locations and Titan powers most of the meta box options for inputting custom fields such as latitude, longitude and other location properties.</p>\n<p>While Intal maintains the framework for the purpose of efficiency in his own work, it&#8217;s now something that anyone can use. &#8220;Titan Framework focuses on ease of use,&#8221; he said. <strong>&#8220;For me, that translates to minimal coding and fewer things to remember.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>When creating the Titan Framework, Intal wanted to make a standardized way of adding options, so that it&#8217;s easy for developers to remember how to accomplish common tasks. He described the problem he was trying to solve and how Titan can improve your workflow:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In WordPress, admin options, custom fields and theme customizer controls are all different from each other. These are set up differently and getting the saved values for each type is performed differently. Titan Framework unifies all these so that you won&#8217;t really have to know whether you&#8217;re using an admin option, a custom field or a customizer control. Everything is just an option. Because of this, getting your saved values is just one simple method: the getOption method.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>How to Include the Titan Framework in Your Project</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/speed-up-wordpress-development-with-the-titan-framework/options-2\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17484\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/options.jpg\" alt=\"options\" width=\"918\" height=\"298\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17484\" /></a><br />\nCurrently, if you want to use Titan with your work, you&#8217;ll need to have the plugin activated alongside your own theme or plugin. This will allow you to call the framework&#8217;s functions inside your project. Refer to the developers&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.titanframework.net/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> on the Titan project page for further instructions and a snippet for checking to see if Titan has been activated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ideally, Titan should always be a plugin that&#8217;s separate from your theme or plugin so that Titan can be updated for bug fixes or new features,&#8221; Intal said. However, he recognizes that some developers might want to bundle the framework within their projects. He plans on performing an update soon that will make that possible.</p>\n<h3>Future Additions to the Titan Framework</h3>\n<p>Intal has plans to expand the number of options in the framework, which currently includes most of the basics. He&#8217;ll be adding a palette selector, widget area selector and menu selector further down the road.</p>\n<p>He also plans to include functionality for easily creating and selecting widget areas, as well as new functions for creating shortcodes.</p>\n<p>Ital said that what he&#8217;s trying to accomplish with Titan is not based on a desire to improve deficiencies he&#8217;s seen in other frameworks. &#8220;When I was in the process of creating Titan Framework, I honestly did not dive into the other existing frameworks since I already had everything I needed to complete it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just started now to check out what&#8217;s out there and I&#8217;m finding that there are a lot of great frameworks such as Redux and OptionTree.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re trying to learn how to code plugin and theme options from the inside out, then using an options framework is not the way to go. The idea behind using a framework is to save yourself time in development and focus on building your project. There&#8217;s no need to reinvent the wheel every time you need to add a few options. Titan saves you the hassle of having to code them from scratch.

portfolios, testimonials, analytics, fundraising capabilities, custom post types etc. Commercial theme providers competed fiercely with one another to see who could pack the most functionality into their offerings. Many companies sought to become a one-stop-shop for everything an individual or business might need in order to launch an online presence.</p>\n<p>The practice of locking users into using a theme by tying their content/data to the use of the theme is now highly discouraged. WordPress theme shops have slowly started to separate function from design in favor of preserving data portability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/restaurant.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17381]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/restaurant1.png\" alt=\"restaurant\" width=\"400\" height=\"252\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-17408\" /></a>This past week we&#8217;ve seen more evidence of this trend as two major theme providers have released plugins for functionality that users might previously have expected to find within themes. Justin Tadlock, who has long been a vocal advocate of <a href=\"http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/09/14/why-custom-post-types-belong-in-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">data portability in themes</a>, released a new free <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/weblog/restaurant-wordpress-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Restaurant</a> plugin. The plugin allows restaurants to manage a food and beverage menu and works as a companion to themes.</p>\n<p>WooThemes released <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2014/02/introducing-projects-our-brand-new-portfolio-plugin-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\">Projects</a> this week, a new plugin to handle portfolio capabilities. They said that preserving data portability is one of the main reasons behind this decision:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’ve probably already noticed that our product strategy has deviated to separating features and code wherever possible, shifting our functionality into plugins, rather than bundling into each theme&#8230;It also ensures your data is portable, which aligns with a core WordPress philosophy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UpThemes&#8217; recent <a href=\"https://upthemes.com/open-letter/\" target=\"_blank\">open letter to the WordPress Community</a> is further demonstration that the tides are turning in favor of data portability. In it, they openly admit that it was impossible for them to continue to support all of the extra stuff that they had been building into themes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Gone are the days of locking custom post types in a theme. No longer do we build pluginesque functionality into the core of a theme. We now build themes that rely on existing, awesome plugins that offer features that can be used with other themes, should you choose to update your design or build your own theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>UpThemes is starting fresh and making use of plugins such as <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/church-theme-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Church Theme Content</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/recipe-schema/\" target=\"_blank\">Recipe Schema</a> to add extra functionality, instead of packing it all into themes.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re witnessing the end of an era in WordPress theme development. Bloat is no longer acceptable. Theme authors are creating leaner products with a stronger focus on designing for specific use cases. Anything extra is plugin territory.</p>\n<p>This should be quite liberating for theme authors who no longer bear the pressure of having to pack all kinds of complex functionality and options into their products. Themes and plugins will no longer overlap as heavily as they have in the past but will act as compliments to one another.</p>\n<h3>Tips For Consumers</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_17423\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-shops-move-towards-preserving-data-portability/portable\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17423\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/portable.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Leo Reynolds - cc\" width=\"1018\" height=\"546\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17423\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/3509878550/\">Leo Reynolds</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking at this issue from a consumer standpoint, the most important thing to remember is that you are the guardian of your own data. If you choose a theme that locks you in, you are the one who will suffer the inconvenience of trying to transfer data when you change to a new theme.</p>\n<p>Before installing a new theme, whether its free or commercial, ask yourself if you&#8217;ll be able to take all of your data with you, if and when you decide to stop using that theme. If the theme advertises dozens of capabilities, examine each of them to make sure that they don&#8217;t tie you down.</p>\n<p>Last year we discussed this issue in a post about <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/why-you-should-never-add-analytics-code-to-your-wordpress-theme\" target=\"_blank\">why you should never add analytics code to your WordPress theme</a>. This is because analytics have nothing to do with the design of the theme. It&#8217;s a function that you&#8217;ll need to maintain throughout years of using WordPress with many different themes. You don&#8217;t want to have to transfer that data every time. Store it in a plugin and be done with it.</p>\n<p>The same goes for portfolios, testimonials, recipes and custom post types.

But it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>\n<p>When we write about plugins on WPTavern, they&#8217;re either cool, innovative, or solve a problem for a large number of users. One of the hardest things to do as a writer is to write about something that is not interesting. The plugins reviewed on WPTavern are seen by a huge audience. I love hearing stories from new plugin authors of how an article on WPTavern put their plugin on the map.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Podcast Dedicated To Plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wppluginsatoz.com/\" title=\"http://wppluginsatoz.com/\">Plugins A-Z</a> is a podcast dedicated to WordPress plugins.

Most plugins are solutions to a problem or scratch a developer&#8217;s itch. By releasing a plugin into the wild, the hope is it will solve the same problem for others. Thank you to every plugin developer who has placed their code onto the WordPress.org plugin repository. More often then not, those plugins are solutions to problems.</p>\n<p><strong>If you know any other outlets authors can use to promote their new plugins, please share them in the comments.  </strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 02:28:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: Own Your Content: Postcard Social Sharing App Launches With WordPress Integration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=17326\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:224:\"http://wptavern.com/own-your-content-postcard-social-sharing-app-launches-with-wordpress-integration?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=own-your-content-postcard-social-sharing-app-launches-with-wordpress-integration\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5397:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/postcard-app.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17326]\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/postcard-app.jpg?resize=301%2C500\" alt=\"postcard-app\" class=\"alignright size-large wp-image-17329\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.postcardsocial.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard</a> is a new free social sharing <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postcard-write-once-share/id589678038?ls=1&mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">app for iOS</a> that landed in the app store today. The app makes it easy for you to share content from your phone to multiple social networks at once.</p>\n<p>The golden feature of this app is its &#8220;Custom Network&#8221; capability, which allows you to share to your own website. Many times people will share content, such as a quick status or photo, to Facebook or Twitter. The content is then hosted on the social networks, which gobble up all the traffic.</p>\n<p>Postcard addresses this problem by allowing you to set your own website as the &#8220;host&#8221; network and direct all the traffic to your site where the content is hosted.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Plugin Connects Postcard to Your Website</h3>\n<p>Given that WordPress is the world&#8217;s leading publishing platform, Postcard&#8217;s creator decided to launch with WordPress integration available from day one.</p>\n<p>This plugin performs two main functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Links the Postcard App to your WordPress site</li>\n<li>Makes it possible to display content sent via Postcard on your site</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you send your content to be hosted on your site, you won&#8217;t have any of the character restrictions that come with sharing to other social networks. The plugin creates shareable permalinks attached to the messages that you share to Facebook, Twitter and other networks.</p>\n<p>The Postcard WordPress plugin also gives you a number of shortcodes to use in the post/page editor for inserting content that comes from the app. The shortcodes make it easy to display an archive, feed or gallery of your Postcard content. The content can also be filtered using the designated attributes, such as tags or count:</p>\n<pre>[postcard-feed tags=\"interesting,useful\"]</pre>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/postcard-social/\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard Social Networking Plugin</a> is available for free on WordPress.org. With the plugin and the app working hand-in-hand, you can create an archive of all the data that you share to social networks from your phone, even if you don&#8217;t choose to use shortcodes to display it on the front-end.</p>\n<h3>Own Your Content and Boost Traffic to Your WordPress Site</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://bitwit.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Newsome</a>, the app&#8217;s creator, said that the ability to share to your own website is the feature that he is the most excited about: &#8220;It represents most strongly why I started building this app in the first place &#8211; to help people solve content ownership and control issues I see prevalent in the shape of social media today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Newsome designed Postcard to be a tool that can help people to keep their website content fresh. <strong>&#8220;There is a big opportunity with this app to make sure your website doesn&#8217;t go stale as you post regular short form content to social networks,&#8221;</strong> he said. Since many people are already putting quite a bit of effort into updating their social networks, Postcard gives you a way to broadcast to all of them while passing the resulting traffic on to your own website.</p>\n<p>One important thing to note is that Postcard doesn&#8217;t store your content or use it to create a social network of any kind. I asked Newsome to clarify how it works. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t store data or use 3rd party servers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All credentials are local and securely stored on the phone.&#8221; This is an important distinction when comparing Postcard to other apps that claim to let you own your own data. If you use the Custom Network feature, the app simply couriers that data to your site where you own the content.</p>\n<h3>An App to Fundamentally Change How We Use Social Networks</h3>\n<p>Postcard presents a new way to interact with social networks. When announcing the upcoming launch, Newsome said, <strong>&#8220;For those of us who are active content creators, I think this marks a very important change in the way we use social media.&#8221;</strong> Having your own website as the canonical source for the content you create has value beyond the traffic that you gain. That link to your site and the fact that you host the data assigns ownership of that content to you. It also provides a lasting archive of your content that can be sorted and presented in any way that you choose.</p>\n<p>Right now <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/postcard-write-once-share/id589678038?ls=1&mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard</a> is only available for iOS. I asked Newsome if an Android app is in the works. He replied, &#8220;Yes, cross-platform is in the plan. I&#8217;m looking at ways to hit both desktop and more mobile platforms.&#8221; As soon as these tools are available, Postcard will be set to double, if not triple its user base, given that Android currently dominates the smartphone market. We&#8217;ll keep you updated as these tools continue to develop.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 21:01:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 05:03:13 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"172233\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 04:45:11 GMT\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20140225125640\";}', 'no');

For $299/year, Business users get unlimited access to premium themes, unlimited storage, live chat and email support, custom domains, no ads and the newest feature: “hassle-free” e-commerce. The company opted to offer its new online stores via partnerships with three hosted e-commerce providers: Ecwid, Shopify, and ShopLocket. Additional and/or monthly fees are also applicable, depending on the store provider selected.  WordPress.com E-Commerce Excludes Native WordPress Solutions Notably absent from its partners are any native WordPress e-commerce plugins. This isn’t surprising, given that Automattic has historically favored SaaS solutions when it comes to WordPress products. The new offering was not without criticism from those who had hoped to see a few of WordPress’ high quality e-commerce plugins thrown into the mix. Commenting on the announcement post, WordPress developer Brent Shepherd said: It’s incredibly exciting to see WordPress.com offer eCommerce, but a real shame to see the many excellent open-source options snubbed (including those built specifically for WordPress). I understand the many very good reasons why it makes sense to partner with existing hosted services, but I hope that one day, we’ll see WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and other open-source eCommerce options alongside these initial launch partners. This is a point of contention for those who would like to see more fluidity for users transitioning between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress installations. A native WordPress e-commerce option might make it easier to transition stores that have outgrown the hosted solution. Whereas some have perceived the decision to partner with outside e-commerce providers as an outright snubbing of WordPress’ home grown solutions, the reality is that most WordPress.com users probably don’t care what’s under the hood to power their stores. If they did, they would likely be more inclined to go the self-hosted route. WordPress.com was created to help make the process of setting up and hosting a WordPress blog virtually painless for those who don’t want to dive into the technical details of setup and maintenance. The e-commerce partners they have selected have a similar audience of sellers who do not wish to be bothered with the technical burden of hosting their own e-commerce installations. The Rising Demand for Hosted E-Commerce WordPress.com’s $299/year price point is actually quite tempting for those who simply want to marry a hosted WordPress blog to a hosted store under one domain. This product attracts those who prefer to offload the burden of PCI compliance, SSL certificates, payment gateway maintenance and everything else required for selling online. Granular control of individual product display is limited to shortcode attributes within the WordPress.com stores, but customers are more than happy to trade deeper level customization for convenience. Aside from slapping a “Pay Now” Paypal button on a website, most modern e-commerce implementations require a tech-savvy administrator who isn’t afraid to tackle a few challenges. A hosted storefront is a more approachable option than the prospect of having to learn everything involved. It’s also more affordable than hiring a developer. Last year we featured Cart66′s launch as a fully managed WordPress e-commerce platform. With Automattic getting into the game, you know there’s a clear demand for this. People are looking to seamlessly couple the power of WordPress publishing with an online storefront and they’re willing to pay for convenience. As more retailers turn to the internet to expand their sales to a global audience, the demand for hosted e-commerce solutions will continue to rise. Any company that can provide a painless experience for customers will take a huge slice of this market.\'>WPTavern: WordPress.com Partners With Hosted E-Commerce Solutions to Launch Online Stores</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/how-to-redirect-automatic-update-email-notifications-in-wordpress?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=how-to-redirect-automatic-update-email-notifications-in-wordpress\' title=\'One of the biggest features to land in WordPress 3.7 were automatic updates. When automatic updates are completed, an email notification is sent to the address specified within Settings &gt; General which is typically the website administrator. However, if you maintain websites for clients, you probably want those notifications to be forwarded to you and not the client. Since other events are tied to the email address such as new user registrations, you can’t substitute the address with your own. Plugin Header A new WordPress plugin called Background Update Notification Email Address developed by Phil Wylie, Laura Vaquero, and Interactive Web Solutions solves the problem by changing the email address update notifications are sent to when an automatic background update is completed. By only changing the email address for automatic update notifications, clients are able to continue receiving emails related to administering their website. Where Updates Will Go After activating the plugin, you’ll find the notification email address located in Settings &gt; Update Notifications. Place the email address where update notifications will go into the field, save the changes and wait for a security or maintenance release of WordPress. Filters and Hooks Are A Plugin Authors Best Friend I asked Phil, how was he able to redirect update notifications without affecting the other administrative emails generated by WordPress. I also asked him why they created the plugin. His response: In terms of how we redirect only the background update emails, WordPress provides us with a handy filter (auto_core_update_email and auto_core_update_send_email) we hook into in order to replace the email address. The filter only fires during an automatic background update and so all other WordPress emails are unaffected. Background updates are a valuable feature of WordPress, ensuring sites receive bug/security fixes quickly. There are a number of plugins which control background update behaviour. However, to my knowledge there are no plugins which redirect the email notifications. Phil suggests if a number of client sites are under your control to create a set of email rules to help organize the notifications. I’ve got this plugin setup in conjunction with a few email rules. Success notifications are archived and failed updates flagged for manual assessment. Great Plugin With One Drawback The only drawback I see is the possibility of clients deactivating the plugin, preventing the email from reaching its intended target. Outside of that, this plugin is a neat example of how the presence of filters and hooks in WordPress give plugin authors the opportunity to bend WordPress to their will.\'>WPTavern: How To Redirect Automatic Update Email Notifications In WordPress</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=better-wordpress-security-plugin-gets-major-update-to-address-security-vulnerabilities\' title=\'Chris Wiegman of iThemes has announced the latest update to the Better WP Security plugin contains fixes for vulnerabilities discovered in 3.6.3.  The updates address compatibility with InfiniteWP, the removal of their in-dashboard support form, and FooPlugins support form code.

GSoC is a global program that offers promising students an opportunity to contribute code to open source projects with a stipend provided by Google. Last year 1,192 students were part of the program. The 2014 program marks the 10th year of GSoC and Google is expecting to sponsor 10% more students than it did in 2013. WordPress is a veteran organization entering its 7th year of participation and is one of 190 mentoring organizations that were selected this year. In 2012 WordPress was rejected as a mentoring organization due to a lack of ideas prepared for student projects. However, this year is a different story. The GSoC 2014 codex page is brimming with ideas and there are more than 20 potential mentors already on board. Here’s a quick sampling of some of the ideas put forth for this summer:  Full-throttle Trac Annihilation Forms Plugin New BuddyPress Template Pack bbPress Per Forum Moderation WordCamp Mobile App Turn the Beta Testers Plugin into a QA Plugin  What does WordPress hope to gain by participating in the GSoC project? This was one of the questions on the application, which was submitted by Jen Mylo. “It’s a good opportunity to reach students who might not otherwise have considered contributing to WordPress,” she said. “And even if they don’t stick around as frequent contributors, it helps us to evaluate how we ramp up and communicate with new contributors.” Several participants from prior years of GSoC have gone on to become valuable contributors to WordPress, including Dion Hulse, Daryl Koopersmith and Andrew Nacin, to name just a few. Student applications open on March 10th. If you’re interested to be part of the program, check out the GSoC 2014 codex page for information on how to apply.\'>WPTavern: WordPress Accepted As A Mentoring Organization For Google Summer of Code 2014</a></li></ul></div>', 'no');

In our practice, there is no such thing as a simple criminal matter.\r\n\r\nFrom DUI and Drug Charges to Vehicular Homicide, Invountary Manslaughter and Premeditated Murder, in Municipal, State or Federal Court, we provide defense of all criminal matters. Contact our office today for a free consultation to discuss the facts and circumstances of your case and to determine the best strategy for a strong defense.\r\n\r\nWhen you are charged with a crime, it is not the time to pick a lawyer at random.  You need a lawyer who has experience, practices exclusively in criminal defense, is known and respected in the jurisdiction where your case is charged, and is devoted to getting the very best result possible in your case.\r\n\r\nSuccess in each case can be measured in different ways. The “gold standard” in criminal defense is outright acquittal of the charges at trial, or dismissal of the charges due to inadmissibility of evidence. Success in a manslaughter case or federal charges with damaging evidence may require extensive negotiations with the prosecutor for conviction on a lesser charge or a recommendation of probation as opposed to imprisonment. No matter what criminal charges you face, your defense should be thoroughly researched, meticulously planned and aggressively litigated. One of my criminal defense strategies is a simple one – We strive to work harder than the prosecution.\r\n\r\nIf you are facing criminal charges, do not leave the outcome of the case or your future to chance. Secure the representation, advice, and counsel of a qualified attorney with experience defending people against criminal charges.', 'Home', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-09-30 11:42:03', '2013-09-30 11:42:03', '', '29', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/29-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

When that trust is violated through misdiagnosis or surgical error, you need an experienced attorney on your side.\r\n<h3>Doctors Deviating From the Standard of Care</h3>\r\nBad results of a surgery or medical procedure do not necessarily indicate medical malpractice. However, if your doctor deviated from accepted standards of care and made a costly mistake, you need the type of representation we provide at Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, to hold that doctor or other health care professional accountable.\r\n<h3>Types of Medical Malpractice</h3>\r\nA doctor\'s error can cause infections that either result in leg amputation. Other common errors include surgical errors, misdiagnoses of brain and spinal injuries, and a failure to diagnose a deadly disease, such as cancer. Dentists and orthodontists can be held accountable if they have fallen short of their standard of care, and caused serious harm.\r\n<h3>Establishing Your Medical Malpractice Case</h3>\r\nIn establishing your medical malpractice case, we need an expert medical opinion on the cause of your injury. That component is critical to establishing your case. Medical malpractice can come in a variety of forms, mandating the need for an experienced attorney and a seasoned medical expert.\r\n\r\nOur office is within walking distance from the metro.

Shared custody will reduce the amount of child support, while joint physical custody provides no opportunity for child support.\r\n<h3>The Child Support Calculator</h3>\r\nThe child support calculator factors in net income of both spouses, with credits for expenses related to health insurance and daycare. Children from another relationship or marriage are also counted in when determining support amounts.\r\n<h3>Ensuring Accuracy of Data in Child Support Amounts</h3>\r\nAt Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, we facilitate the difficult and sometimes emotional elements of determining child support. While the final number is based on calculations, the data entered in must be accurate. Spouses engaged in hiding assets or finances to reduce support amounts can be held accountable if money has been concealed from the other spouse.\r\n\r\nOur office is within walking distance from the metro.

Even worse is a case in which the injury could have been prevented. For these reasons, laws exist in Maryland that give victims and their families the right to pursue medical malpractice cases. Not only can this alleviate some of their burden from medical expenses and ongoing treatment and care, but it can give hospital and medical practitioners extra incentive to be sure their procedures are carried out with accuracy and safety, to prevent doctor errors.\r\n\r\nA family was recently awarded $5.25 million in a medical negligence claim against Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The Ohio Court of Claims determined the hospital was responsible for the couple\'s son being born with brain damage that resulted in permanent disability in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe baby boy was delivered by an emergency C-section, but the court found that the doctor didn’t properly manage the mother’s labor. He allegedly took too long to realize the C-section was needed, and the baby suffered from blood and oxygen loss. Additionally, two other doctors affirmed that the obstetrician didn’t properly manage the use of Pitocin during the woman’s labor, further resulting in the baby’s permanent brain injury.\r\n\r\nThe boy, now seven years old, requires constant care, which of course has resulted in mounting medical bills. The parents have stated their satisfaction with the settlement, which should help with the compensation of his care and medical expenses. It can also be hoped that more care will be taken with future labors and deliveries to prevent the same type of tragic birth injury from happening to any other babies.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>The Columbus Dispatch, “<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/06/27/malpractice-claim-settled.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury during birth costs Ohio State hospital $5.25 million</a>,” Ben Sutherly, June 28, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Ohio hospital found responsible for birth injury', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ohio-hospital-found-responsible-for-birth-injury', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '', '0', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/?p=846', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Even worse is a case in which the injury could have been prevented. For these reasons, laws exist in Maryland that give victims and their families the right to pursue medical malpractice cases. Not only can this alleviate some of their burden from medical expenses and ongoing treatment and care, but it can give hospital and medical practitioners extra incentive to be sure their procedures are carried out with accuracy and safety, to prevent doctor errors.\r\n\r\nA family was recently awarded $5.25 million in a medical negligence claim against Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The Ohio Court of Claims determined the hospital was responsible for the couple\'s son being born with brain damage that resulted in permanent disability in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe baby boy was delivered by an emergency C-section, but the court found that the doctor didn’t properly manage the mother’s labor. He allegedly took too long to realize the C-section was needed, and the baby suffered from blood and oxygen loss. Additionally, two other doctors affirmed that the obstetrician didn’t properly manage the use of Pitocin during the woman’s labor, further resulting in the baby’s permanent brain injury.\r\n\r\nThe boy, now seven years old, requires constant care, which of course has resulted in mounting medical bills. The parents have stated their satisfaction with the settlement, which should help with the compensation of his care and medical expenses. It can also be hoped that more care will be taken with future labors and deliveries to prevent the same type of tragic birth injury from happening to any other babies.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>The Columbus Dispatch, “<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/06/27/malpractice-claim-settled.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury during birth costs Ohio State hospital $5.25 million</a>,” Ben Sutherly, June 28, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Ohio hospital found responsible for birth injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '846-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '', '846', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/846-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Whether they are injured in a fall, an automobile collision or other kind of incident, brain injury victims must often contend with lifelong side effects and consequences. And while there is so much that researchers and doctors still don’t know about the nature of many traumatic brain injuries, a new two-year study may help shed light on injury cases and how they relate to other medical conditions.\r\n\r\nThe research study will be conducted by scientists with the Paul G. Allen Institute for Brain Science and the University of Washington, and is expected to cost more than $2 million. Researchers will examine the molecular, structural and cellular makeup of the human brain and analyze how such components are impacted by injury and trauma.\r\n\r\nPaul Allen is spearheading the project, and also asked a neurosurgeon with the University of Washington Seahawks team to collaborate on the research. As the owner of the Seahawks and the cofounder of Microsoft, Allen has the scientific resources and personal investment necessary to propel the study.

If someone else\'s negligence is the cause of a head injury, the victims are entitled to seek compensation for their medical expenses and other problems resulting from the accident.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: York News Times, \"<a href=\"http://www.yorknewstimes.com/news/brain-injury-awareness-month/article_5034d4b8-9376-11e2-99ff-0019bb2963f4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury awareness month</a>,\" Mar. 23, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Be aware of the signs of brain injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '886-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '', '886', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/886-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Because children\'s depth perception is still developing, the pediatric specialist recommends protective lenses, especially for children who wear glasses, and a face shield for the batter\'s helmet.\r\n\r\nOther risks common to baseball include shoulder and elbow injuries with pitchers and catchers, the risk of being hit by a thrown bat, and inattention by players not currently in the game. Experts caution for coaches to teach kids to be attentive at all times, even while in the dugout.\r\n\r\nBeing seriously injured while playing a sport can cause a liability issue for the sports team or owner of the property where games are played. Many popular spring and summer sports carry the risk of head trauma, broken bones, and other injuries, but most experts agree that with the proper training and precautions, there\'s no reason not to have fun and enjoy summer sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: NewsMedical.net, \"<a href=\"http://www.news-medical.net/news/20130328/Children-are-vulnerable-to-eye-injury-while-playing-baseball-expert-says.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Children are vulnerable to eye injury while playing baseball, expert says</a>,\" Mar. 28, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Baseball is good exercise, but carries the risk of child injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '898-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:43:02', '2014-02-28 07:43:02', '', '898', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/898-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

They combat obesity, are healthy for the heart and lungs, and keep people in shape. However, there are certain sports that health professionals consider too dangerous to continue, at least for children. Most of these sports involve a greater risk of serious head or spinal injuries as well as broken bones.\r\n\r\nA children\'s sport that has been gaining popularity over the past few years is youth mixed martial arts, also known as Pankration. This mixed martial arts sport has been called violent and dangerous by opponents. Maryland is among several states that have introduced legislation to address the concerns related to the safety of this sport.\r\n\r\nAlthough rules set forth by the United States Fight League prohibit children under age 16 from hitting opponents in the head, serious injuries can still occur, say leading pediatricians. The director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research says severe trauma can result from the violent actions of this sport. Damage to the neck and spine, including paralysis, are risks. He believes youth MMA should be banned.\r\n\r\nA pediatric sports medicine specialist and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness calls youth MMA troubling due to the potential for permanent disability by concussions and other injuries.\r\n\r\nFor now, it\'s up to parents to decide whether to allow their children to participate in this sport or to put them into something less combative. From a personal injury perspective, the possibility exists for local or national leagues -- or even parents themselves -- being held liable for injuries sustained during the participation of dangerous sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: HLNTV.com, \"<a href=\"http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/02/02/young-mma-fighters\" target=\"_blank\">Kids punch, kick &amp; tackle their way to the top</a>,\" Allison Gilbert, Feb. 2, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Concussions, spinal cord injuries among dangers of youth MMA', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'concussions-spinal-cord-injuries-among-dangers-of-youth-mma', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '', '0', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/?p=910', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Most of these sports involve a greater risk of serious head or spinal injuries as well as broken bones.\r\n\r\nA children\'s sport that has been gaining popularity over the past few years is youth mixed martial arts, also known as Pankration. This mixed martial arts sport has been called violent and dangerous by opponents. Maryland is among several states that have introduced legislation to address the concerns related to the safety of this sport.\r\n\r\nAlthough rules set forth by the United States Fight League prohibit children under age 16 from hitting opponents in the head, serious injuries can still occur, say leading pediatricians. The director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research says severe trauma can result from the violent actions of this sport. Damage to the neck and spine, including paralysis, are risks. He believes youth MMA should be banned.\r\n\r\nA pediatric sports medicine specialist and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness calls youth MMA troubling due to the potential for permanent disability by concussions and other injuries.\r\n\r\nFor now, it\'s up to parents to decide whether to allow their children to participate in this sport or to put them into something less combative. From a personal injury perspective, the possibility exists for local or national leagues -- or even parents themselves -- being held liable for injuries sustained during the participation of dangerous sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: HLNTV.com, \"<a href=\"http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/02/02/young-mma-fighters\" target=\"_blank\">Kids punch, kick &amp; tackle their way to the top</a>,\" Allison Gilbert, Feb. 2, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Concussions, spinal cord injuries among dangers of youth MMA', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '910-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '', '910', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/910-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

No matter how habitual any kind of medical procedure becomes, however, it is the duty of medical professionals to account for possible complications and risks so that they are prepared in the event of an emergency. One dentist is accused of medical malpractice for allegedly failing to prevent and treat complications that resulted in a young patient sustaining severe brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe initial incident occurred in late 2013, when the three-year-old girl in the case underwent a root canal procedure. At that time, the child’s parents claim that she was left unchecked for close to half an hour after being sedated. The dentist that reportedly performed the procedure worked with a children’s dentistry office, and is accused of making serious medication mistakes that caused the child to go into cardiac arrest. It is also argued that the improper dosage and administration of medications during the procedure caused the child to suffer major brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe pediatric patient was later diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state as a result of brain damage. At that point she was moved into hospice care from a hospital setting. Sadly, the little girl recently died.\r\n\r\nThe dentistry practice implicated in the case is apparently closed down; though, the dentist identified as the defendant in the malpractice lawsuit had no comment.

No matter how habitual any kind of medical procedure becomes, however, it is the duty of medical professionals to account for possible complications and risks so that they are prepared in the event of an emergency. One dentist is accused of medical malpractice for allegedly failing to prevent and treat complications that resulted in a young patient sustaining severe brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe initial incident occurred in late 2013, when the three-year-old girl in the case underwent a root canal procedure. At that time, the child’s parents claim that she was left unchecked for close to half an hour after being sedated. The dentist that reportedly performed the procedure worked with a children’s dentistry office, and is accused of making serious medication mistakes that caused the child to go into cardiac arrest. It is also argued that the improper dosage and administration of medications during the procedure caused the child to suffer major brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe pediatric patient was later diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state as a result of brain damage. At that point she was moved into hospice care from a hospital setting. Sadly, the little girl recently died.\r\n\r\nThe dentistry practice implicated in the case is apparently closed down; though, the dentist identified as the defendant in the malpractice lawsuit had no comment. The parents of the young victim are accusing the dentist and facility of recklessness and negligence. Their lawsuit claims that the defendant was ill-equipped to handle the medical emergency their daughter experienced.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>CNN, “<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/04/justice/hawaii-girl-dead/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hawaii girl, 3, dies after dental procedure</a>,” Khushbu Shah, Jan. 4, 2014\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Pediatric patient may have been victim of anesthesia error', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '922-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 09:36:29', '2014-02-28 09:36:29', '', '922', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/922-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

He returned to the game in August, and the Yankees team contends that A-Rod didn’t complain about his left hip prior to surgery. He had already undergone surgery for his right hip four years ago. However, A-Rod argues that he was forced to play baseball even though his left hip was seriously injured at the time.\r\n\r\nIn his recently filed medical malpractice lawsuit, A-Rod claims that the physician that treated him concealed the nature of his hip injury, allowing him to play when he shouldn’t have. A hospital in New York is also identified as a defendant in the case. A-Rod argues that he suffered emotional distress and anguish as a result of the mistreatment he allegedly endured, along with pain and suffering. Although, there is no information on what damages, if any, he is seeking in the case.\r\n\r\nThe question may be raised whether the plaintiff’s claims should be addressed to his players’ union or the Major League Baseball association. These accusations come as the baseball player confronts disputes with the baseball commissioner, the MLB, and the MLB Players Association over an impending game suspension.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>thespec.com, “<a href=\"http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/4145402-mlb-a-rod-suing-yankees-team-doctor-new-york-city-hospital-over-pain-agony-distress-/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB: A-Rod suing Yankees team doctor, New York City hospital over \'pain, agony, distress\'</a>,” David B.

What most people wouldn\'t expect, however, is for medical professionals to make a mistake about whether their patient is actually dead before making post-mortem procedures.\r\n\r\nWhen a New York woman was taken to the emergency room for a drug overdose at St. Joseph\'s Hospital Center in 2009, doctors pronounced her dead and informed her family. However, a nurse told the doctors the woman had been showing signs of recovering. Despite this knowledge, doctors obtained consent from the woman\'s family to remove her from life support and harvest her organs.\r\n\r\nThe woman showed several signs of still being alive, such as passing a reflex test, apparently breathing on her own, and moving her lips and tongue. Perhaps most disturbing was the doctors’ instructions to the nurse to give the woman a strong sedative before cutting into her to remove her organs--a procedure that would not be necessary on a dead person. The woman awoke just before doctors were about to begin the surgery to remove her organs.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was sanctioned but only fined $22,000, and the victim and her family didn’t sue the hospital for their grievous mistake. Sadly, the woman committed suicide due to depression in 2011.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a centralized system doesn’t exist that requires hospitals to report mistakes. Perhaps if hospitals were made accountable for such errors, standardized procedures and reporting systems would be created to prevent other patients from harm.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>Yahoo!

Hopefully in the future, we\'ll see if reporting errors more thoroughly can help prevent life-changing or fatal medical errors.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: The Boston Globe, \"<a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2013/04/09/brigham-and-women-publishes-stories-medical-errors-focus-staff-attention-solutions/heFVdgGnLc2O9QqL1eiMnN/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brigham and Women\'s airing medical mistakes</a>,\" Liz Kowalczyk, April 9, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Hospital discloses mistakes to improve care, prevent errors', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '970-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 10:24:56', '2014-02-28 10:24:56', '', '970', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/970-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Another problem is misdated, lost or out-of-date test results showing up in the records, which could cause unnecessary procedures to be ordered -- or urgently needed treatment to be delayed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source: </strong>Kaiser Health News, \"<a href=\"http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2012/12/hhs-stops-short-of-calling-for-safety-regulation-of-digital-records/\" target=\"_blank\">HHS Stops Short Of Calling For Safety Regulation Of Digital Records</a>,\" Jay Hancock, Dec. 21, 2012\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Electronic health records system causing plenty of problems', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '982-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 10:38:20', '2014-02-28 10:38:20', '', '982', 'http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/982-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

At Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, in Hyattsville, Maryland, we bring that knowledge of the law in representing state residents and clients who live in<img class=\"alignright  wp-image-821\" alt=\"i-prac-divorceandseparation\" src=\"http://odelugo.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/i-prac-divorceandseparation.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"253\" /> Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n<p>Divorce is an emotionally-charged legal matter. You and your spouse need to make critical decision related to the family\'s future. We can facilitate that decision-making process and resolve your case through mediation or litigation.</p>\r\n<h3>The Differences in Divorce Law</h3>\r\n<p>Divorce in Washington, D.C., is an easier process. Essentially, the district is a \"no-fault state,\" where divorce can occur after six months of a legal separation. Clients in Maryland face more complexity in lengthier divorce matters. Voluntary separation of one year or mutual separation (also known as limited divorce) of two years is required before a divorce. Instances of adultery, cruelty, abandonment, desertion, constructive desertion, mental illness or incarceration may warrant departure from the requirement.</p>\r\n<h3>Helping Clients Resolve Divorce Matters</h3>\r\n<p>At Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, we have experience with and knowledge of complex areas of the law. We assist clients in the mediation process, particularly when it comes to child custody matters. We also facilitate discussions to determine child support amounts, alimony payments and the division of property in divorce. Whether the setting is the mediation table or the courtroom, we will aggressive advocate for what you are entitled to by law and your rights overall.</p>\r\n<p>Our office is within walking distance from the metro.
