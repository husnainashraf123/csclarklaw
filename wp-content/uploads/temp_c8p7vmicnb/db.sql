I bonded out and was supposed to go to court on the 23, for my Denton case, but I got the date mixed up and thought it was on the 28.  My Cameron County lawyers are taking care of my case down there, for which I had my last court appointment today,  and one of them asked a colleague from the Denton area to submit the papers to have my bond reinstated in Denton, but it was denied.  Since my Lawyers aren\\\'t familiar with the Denton courts, I was advised to consult with a local attorney on what they thought would be my best course of actions and for consultation.  I was told the bond is set for 2 cash bonds totaling $22,000.  This is for a misdemeanor 2nd offense and there are two case numbers, Case No. CR-2013-06307-B and Case No. CR-2013-06474-B.  One is for failure to appear to the Arraignment Hearing, and the other is for a no show to the Bond Condition Hearing.  I had gone to see a probation officer back in May, around the time I got arrested for my second offense, who gave me the information needed to get the Interlock device installed in my car, which I did within the time-frame I was given, and have kept up with all of the recalibration services requested since.\r\nWould you be able to help me with this?  Would it be possible to get the bonds reduced?  The fines are at a 3rd offense level, yet, this is my 2nd offense.  If not now, after 30 days?  Is it possible to get the bond reinstated and a new court date?  Should I turn myself in today or would it be okay if I waited until Monday or some other time next week?  (My lease just expired so I would have to move my stuff into a storage unit or renew my lease.  Also, I have to wait for my Mother to drive up from Brownsville, TX, which is 9 hours away, to pick up my pets and car.  She wouldn\\\'t be able to make it until later tonight since she has to work today).\r\nI graduated from UTA in July 2012 with a B.S. in Business Information Systems and I currently have a job as a Search Engine Optimizer agent.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nDaniel Myers\r\n(956) 466-9924', '2013-11-01 16:58:40');

Be on the lookout for cleaner markup. Also try the new paste handling &#8212; if you paste in a block of text from Microsoft Word, for example, it will no longer come out terrible. (The &#8220;Paste from Word&#8221; button you probably never noticed has been removed.) It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112\">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785\">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055\">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959\">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845\">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class=\"closed\" title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409\">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811\">#21811</a>).</li>\n<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631\">#26631</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/major\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=component&amp;milestone=3.9\">everything we’ve fixed</a> so far.</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.9, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>DEVELOPERS!</strong> Hello! There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/\">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003\">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663\">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272\">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799\">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351\">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560\">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663\">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>).</li>\n<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x\">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">implementation ticket</a> for more.

Gone are overbearing gradients and dozens of shades of grey — bring on a bigger, bolder, more colorful design!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2856\" style=\"margin-left: 0;margin-right: 0\" alt=\"about-modern-wordpress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/design.png?resize=623%2C151\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Modern aesthetic</h3>\n<p>The new WordPress dashboard has a fresh, uncluttered design that embraces clarity and simplicity.</p>\n<h3>Clean typography</h3>\n<p>The Open Sans typeface provides simple, friendly text that is optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility. With superior contrast and large, comfortable type, the new design is easy to read and a pleasure to navigate.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">WordPress on every device</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2984\" alt=\"responsive\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/responsive.jpg?resize=255%2C255\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />We all access the internet in different ways. Smartphone, tablet, notebook, desktop — no matter what you use, WordPress will adapt and you’ll feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>High definition at high speed</h3>\n<p>WordPress is sharper than ever with new vector-based icons that scale to your screen. By ditching pixels, pages load significantly faster, too.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Admin color schemes to match your personality</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-2954\" alt=\"colors\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/colors.jpg?resize=623%2C339\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress just got a colorful new update. We’ve included eight new admin color schemes so you can pick the one that suits you best.</p>\n<p>Color schemes can be previewed and changed from your Profile page.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Refined theme management</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-2967\" alt=\"themes\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/themes.jpg?resize=360%2C344\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />The new themes screen lets you survey your themes at a glance. Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789\" alt=\"The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen. Choose a grid or a slider to display featured content on your homepage. Customize your site with three widget areas or change your layout with two page templates.</p>\n<p>With a striking design that does not compromise our trademark simplicity, Twenty Fourteen is our most intrepid default theme yet.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Beginning of a new era</h2>\n<p>This release was led by Matt Mullenweg.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7\">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7\">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">on the make/core blog</a>.

I&#8217;ve helped put the meeting together since 2009. Usually, we&#8217;ll have 10-25 people show up depending on the weather or if the event is on a holiday. Meetups are like a smaller version of WordCamps where individuals present on specific topics each month. Now that we have a healthy nucleus of regular attendees, the meetups almost run themselves.</p>\n<h3>Using Meetup.com To Start A Meetup</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_19139\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UsingMeetup.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-19139\" alt=\"A Lot Of Meetups Happening In My Area\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/UsingMeetup-500x164.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"164\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Lot Of Meetups Happening In My Area</p></div>\n<p>I recently saw someone ask how they can start a WordPress meetup. They lived in a city with a population of 75,000 people and according to Meetup.com, a WordPress group didn&#8217;t exist in their area. Launched in 2002, <a title=\"http://www.meetup.com/\" href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a> is the most popular website for getting people with like-minded ideas together. The site has meetups for any topic under the sun.</p>\n<p>Meetup organizers need to pay organizer dues before the meetup can be established on the site. Meetup.com has three pricing plans available and each plan allows you to run up to three separate meetups.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$12 a month for 6 months (a single $72 charge)</li>\n<li>$15 a month for 3 months (a single $45 charge)</li>\n<li>$19 per month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WordPress foundation has a <a title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/meetup-interest-form/\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community/meetup-interest-form/\">program in place</a> that will pay membership dues so long as the group follows a few guidelines. In a nutshell:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress meetups are for the benefit of the local community and are not to be used primarily for business purposes.</li>\n<li>The <a title=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\" href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\">WordPress and WordCamp trademarks</a> should be respected.</li>\n<li>The meetup should foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re organizing a WordPress meetup solely for the purpose of meeting potential clients, you&#8217;re missing the point of what a community organized event is.</p>\n<h3>Try Not To Start A Meetup Alone</h3>\n<p>If possible, try to find one or two other people in your local area interested in having a WordPress meetup. In 2009, I asked on Twitter  if anyone in the North East Ohio area would be interested in attending a WordPress meetup. I discovered <a title=\"http://thecodecave.com/\" href=\"http://thecodecave.com/\">Brian Layman </a>who is a respected WordPress developer was just a short drive away from me as was <a title=\"http://kimparsell.com/\" href=\"http://kimparsell.com/\">Kim Parsell</a> and <a title=\"http://jefflee.co/\" href=\"http://jefflee.co/\">Jeff Lee</a>. I coordinated with them over Twitter and email to establish the core meetup group.</p>\n<p>Once we had a small dedicated group of individuals attending the meetup, we used our collective social media presence to announce and recruit interested members to the meetup. Keep in mind Meetup.com will notify registered users in the area when a new meetup is created that matches their interests. Also consider using the <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-the-meetups-forum\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/about-the-meetups-forum\">WordPress.org Meetup Forum</a> to tell others about the meetup.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19137\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEOWPMeetup1.jpeg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19137\" alt=\"Brian Layman Sharing Knowledge\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEOWPMeetup1.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Brian Layman Sharing Knowledge</p></div>\n<p>I was lucky to have two to three people help me kick-start our meetup. If you can&#8217;t find attendees on Twitter or Facebook, try attending meetups in your area that are similar to WordPress. For instance, meetups on web design, content management, SEO, etc. will likely have a few WordPress people in attendance.</p>\n<h3>Finding A Venue</h3>\n<p>Finding a venue to host a meetup can be difficult. I recommend a place that has good WiFi, is somewhat quiet and set up for presentations. Co-working spaces are a great option to host a meetup since most of them contain the amenities I&#8217;ve outlined above. They have the side benefit of sometimes hosting workers that have an interest in WordPress. If you end up using a co-working space, ask around to see if anyone has an interest in WordPress. They could be your newest members to your meetup!</p>\n<h3>Immediately Establish Consistency</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest lessons learned while organizing a meetup is how important it is for the event to happen consistently at the same time. In the past, our meetup didn&#8217;t have a specific day of the month and was created when we felt like meeting up. This left people questioning whether or not there would be another meetup the following month.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19141\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MeetupConsistency.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-19141\" alt=\"Schedule The Meetup To Happen At The Same Time Every Month\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MeetupConsistency.png\" width=\"523\" height=\"242\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make Your Meetup Predictable</p></div>\n<p>By immediately establish consistency, you&#8217;re giving attendees a chance to plan around your meetup. For example, ours is held on the fourth Thursday of every month. The only time it changes is during inclement weather or during a holiday. It&#8217;s important you communicate schedule changes as soon as possible to give attendees a chance to change their plans.</p>\n<h3>How Long Should The Meetup Be?</h3>\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to have a time limit unless the venue requires you to leave at a certain time. Our meetup is typically two hours long with the first hour dedicated to a topic. Topics are decided either from the previous meeting or from users in our meetup.com group. If you&#8217;re thinking about doing a presentation at a WordCamp, meetups are an excellent opportunity to hone your skills. Presenting in front of 15-30 people is less stressful than a room of 50-100.</p>\n<h3>WordCamps Usually Start As Meetups First</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19057]\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-12640\" alt=\"WordCamp Dayton 2014\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/WordCampDayton2014Logo-150x150.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>When I asked Nathan Driver how <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dayton-a-flying-success\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/first-wordcamp-dayton-a-flying-success\">WordCamp Dayton, Ohio</a> started, he told me it began with their local meetup. After visiting WordCamps throughout the state of Ohio, he discovered many of the attendees were from Southwest Ohio and wanted an event closer to home. He created a meetup around the Dayton area to gauge interest. “<em>After a couple of months of debating we went for it and had our first MeetUp in October 2012″.</em> After managing the meetup for a couple of months, Driver noticed interest grew along with memberships which is when he decided to begin the process of creating a WordCamp.</p>\n<h3>Starting A Meetup Is Not Hard But Requires Work and Dedication</h3>\n<p>Meetups require dedication and consistency to develop a community of their own. Don&#8217;t be discouraged if only three to five people show up. Use your meetup.com page as a hub and encourage attendees to leave feedback after every meeting. Make sure communication channels are open between the organizer and the attendees so everyone within the group is on the same page.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, have fun. Meetups don&#8217;t have to be serious and in my opinion, shouldn&#8217;t be. They are informal gatherings of people from all backgrounds united by an interest in WordPress.  If you have any suggestions for new WordPress meetup organizers, please add them in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 21:57:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Treehouse Expands WordPress Education to Include BuddyPress Beginners Course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19096\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:216:\"http://wptavern.com/treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3358:\"<p>Just one month after launching its <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/high-demand-for-wordpress-education-prompts-treehouse-to-launch-new-beginners-course\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress beginner&#8217;s course</a>, Treehouse has added BuddyPress education to its collection of interactive learning resources. The &#8220;<a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/library/learn-buddypress-social-networks-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Learn BuddyPress</a>&#8221; course is geared toward BuddyPress beginners and covers all the basics of setup, user management, and core social components.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buddypress-treehouse.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19096]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/buddypress-treehouse.png\" alt=\"buddypress-treehouse\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19116\" /></a></p>\n<p>After reviewing the course, I was impressed by how quickly Gordon is able to communicate all the basics for gaining competence with BuddyPress, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting Started With BuddyPress:</strong> How to Install BP and configure its settings, register users and use the codex</li>\n<li><strong>BuddyPress Member Profiles:</strong> Setting up extended profile user fields, members page, status updates, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Interactions in BuddyPress:</strong> Friend connections, private messaging, mentioning users, notifications, activity, groups</li>\n<li><strong>Customizing BuddyPress:</strong> BP plugins, themes and customizations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each component is covered in great detail from both a user and community manager perspective. If you learn best by watching videos, then this course may be a good option for you, as it also includes an accompanying video transcript for each section. The lessons include links to the <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress codex</a> for further reference on the topics discussed.</p>\n<h3>Treehouse Plans to Add More BuddyPress Education Resources</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://zacgordon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zac Gordon</a>, Treehouse&#8217;s instructor for the course, said that they&#8217;ve been experiencing an increase in demand for BuddyPress education resources. He plans to create a BuddyPress Theme Development course to follow and may add a plugin development course sometime further down the road.</p>\n<p>With Treehouse&#8217;s expansion into resources for major WordPress plugins, I asked him if other extensions will be featured. &#8220;bbPress is definitely on my radar, although I&#8217;ve had no requests for it,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Jetpack would be a cool idea too, since we just did the WordPress.com course.&#8221; He&#8217;s currently experimenting with different course lengths and may produce a quick Jetpack resource within the next month or two.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/library/learn-buddypress-social-networks-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">Learn BuddyPress</a> course is the first of its kind with in-depth video tutorials for every aspect of using BuddyPress. This is a great resource for teaching yourself the basics of BuddyPress over a weekend. The course is also a high quality option for BuddyPress developers to recommend to clients for basic support on how to use BuddyPress&#8217; core features.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 19:21:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress.tv: Chris Lema: WordCamp Las Vegas 2013 Opening Keynote\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=33164\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/17/chris-lema-wordcamp-las-vegas-2013-opening-keynote/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:655:\"<div id=\"v-jsJVSQLw-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/33164/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/33164/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=33164&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/17/chris-lema-wordcamp-las-vegas-2013-opening-keynote/\"><img alt=\"Chris Lema: Opening Keynote\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/jsJVSQLw/video-e208f2e698_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:59:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: 10up Hires CEO To Help Take Company To The Next Level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18705\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:170:\"http://wptavern.com/10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2756:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18705]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-13736\" alt=\"10up Logo\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/10UpLogo.jpg\" width=\"139\" height=\"164\" /></a>WordPress development agency <a title=\"http://10up.com/\" href=\"http://10up.com/\">10up</a> has <a title=\"http://10up.com/blog/john-eckman-ceo/\" href=\"http://10up.com/blog/john-eckman-ceo/\">hired John Eckman</a> to take on the role of CEO. Eckman will work closely with Goldman and team leaders on the day-to-day operations of the company. Jake Goldman will remain as president and will focus on the products, strategic investments, and business development side of the company.</p>\n<p>Eckman has spent the last 15 years in the CMS ecosystem with five different companies both in the open-source and non open-source space. Before 10up, he worked for <a title=\"http://www.isitedesign.com/\" href=\"http://www.isitedesign.com/\">iSite Design</a>, a company that has a portfolio filled with companies from start-ups to non-profits to fortune 25 industry leaders.</p>\n<h3>Removing Obstacles To Enable More Efficient Employees</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obstaclesign.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18705]\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-19066\" alt=\"obstaclesign\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obstaclesign-249x300.png\" width=\"249\" height=\"300\" /></a>In the short-term, Eckman will observe how the company functions, locate growing pains and determine any obstacles he can remove to help employees become more efficient. Sometimes, a hiring like this can lead to immediate and drastic changes but Eckman wants the transition to be as smooth as possible. He doesn&#8217;t want to change the company culture if it&#8217;s working. Longer term, he wants to &#8220;<em>Make the team as efficient as possible. Remove non-productive frustrations and empower employees to be as productive as possible</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<h3>Executing The Vision</h3>\n<p>The hiring enables 10up to continue growing and to take on bigger projects. However, Eckman noted he wants to see the company continue to take on smaller more nimble projects. The goal is to have a wide-ranging portfolio showcasing the strengths of the company no matter how small or large the project. When I asked Eckman to summarize his position in the company, he said, &#8220;<em>Jake will drive the vision, I&#8217;ll execute it</em>&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Also check out Brian Krogsgard&#8217;s <a title=\"http://www.poststat.us/evolution-10up/\" href=\"http://www.poststat.us/evolution-10up/\">hour long interview </a>where he sat down and talked to Jake Goldman and 10up&#8217;s new CEO John Eckman.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:22:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: How to Restrict a WordPress Author to Posting in One Category\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=19061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:186:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-restrict-a-wordpress-author-to-posting-in-one-category?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-restrict-a-wordpress-author-to-posting-in-one-category\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2726:\"<div id=\"attachment_19081\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/writing-featured.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/writing-featured.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Nic\'s events - cc\" width=\"1021\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19081\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nics_events/2349632625/\">Nic&#8217;s events</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Multi-author WordPress blogs often have many authors working together to push out content, but not every author needs access to post to all categories on the site. In fact, there may be times when you want to limit an author to posting in just one assigned category for contributions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/restrict-author-posting/\" target=\"_blank\">Restrict Author Posting</a> is a new plugin that allows administrators to restrict authors, on an individual basis, to post in only one category. This is a lightweight, specific-use plugin that doesn&#8217;t alter any other capabilities or permissions.</p>\n<p>Once you install it, administrators can navigate to each user that they want to restrict and assign a category.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-1.png\" alt=\"restrict-author-posting-1\" width=\"709\" height=\"283\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19088\" /></a></p>\n<p>When the author goes to create a new post, the meta box listing all of the categories will not be available. Instead, the author will see a notice of which category the post will fall under.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19061]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/restrict-author-posting-2.png\" alt=\"restrict-author-posting-2\" width=\"580\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-19089\" /></a></p>\n<p>Restrict Author Posting is a plugin that you might never think of until you have a situation where you need it. Put it in place to streamline contributions on a multi-author site by herding authors into their assigned categories. This saves you the trouble of having to double check posts to make sure they fall under the correct category. It also helps to ensure that authors don&#8217;t go crazy creating new categories for every post.

While learning how to build a custom content management system, he stumbled upon WordPress and started fiddling around with it to learn more about its features. At the age of 14, he landed his first client. WordPress ticked all the boxes for the client&#8217;s requirements and Sunny launched his career as a professional WordPress developer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_19010\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[19002]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Photo-300x249.jpg\" alt=\"Sunny Ratilal\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sunny Ratilal<br /></p></div>\n<p>Fast forward to three years later, Sunny is now 17 years old and currently in Sixth Form in London. When not busy studying, he enjoys developing custom plugins for clients and is also a prolific contributor to <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, having logged an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/commits?author=sunnyratilal\" target=\"_blank\">1,097 commits</a> to the codebase.</p>\n<h3>Learning By Contributing to Open Source Projects</h3>\n<p>While contributing to EDD, Sunny said he has learned a great deal about working in remote teams. &#8220;Working alongside EDD developers, we&#8217;re scattered all around the World!  Some are based in the US, England and even New Zealand! Remote teams are fantastic because it always means someone is around whatever time of the day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Getting involved in EDD changed Sunny&#8217;s life and opened him up to a new world of collaboration. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">Open source software has empowered me to code</span>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Contributing to EDD was my first open source project which gave me confidence to contribute to other smaller plugins and then eventually WordPress Core, submitting my first patch to WordPress last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Since his first foray into commercial products involved building extensions for a popular plugin, I asked Sunny if he has any advice to others who want to be successful in that space. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t build the extension because it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s required, build it because you want to build it. Build something you&#8217;re really passionate about; that&#8217;s what&#8217;ll give you the most pleasure whilst coding it. The key to success is not all about marketing the plugin, it&#8217;s about how the plugin is written.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sunny advises developers to keep it clean and simple. He offered five tips for building extensions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write clean code</li>\n<li>Document it very well</li>\n<li>Make the code efficient, don&#8217;t have hundreds of WP_Query instances or load hundreds of JavaScript/CSS files.</li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t give the customers a chance to complain, have a feature list built and always beta test</li>\n<li>Provide excellent support to all customers</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Importance of WordPress Role Models</h3>\n<p>While learning and working with WordPress, Sunny said that having good role models inspired him to further develop his skills. &#8220;I have three very important role models: all three are fellow WordPress developers: <a href=\"http://tommcfarlin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom McFarlin</a>, <a href=\"http://pippinsplugins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pippin Williamson</a> and <a href=\"http://markjaquith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Jaquith</a>,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are exceptional developers who have a myriad of knowledge. <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">The plugins/themes they create are made with other developers in mind and their coding is by far some of the best you will ever see.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sunny is hoping to advance his skills along the same path he&#8217;s seen forged by the aforementioned developers. &#8220;I can say with a great amount of certainty that you can learn something new from every single commit to plugins/themes/WordPress Tom, Mark and Pippin make.&#8221; As is the case in many technical professions, Sunny has learned the most by doing and by watching other high performing developers.</p>\n<h3>A Bright Future for Sunny Ratilal</h3>\n<p>What does the future hold for Sunny Ratilal? He&#8217;s got one more year before entering university. Meanwhile, he is studying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics. He hopes to study Computer Science at University.</p>\n<p>He also plans to continue his work with EDD and WordPress. At the moment, he&#8217;s taking a break from EDD contributions to focus on his schoolwork. Pursuing a career in WordPress is something he&#8217;s considered, and he plans to continue developing while getting his education. &#8220;I love building WordPress plugins and themes and have no intention to stop doing so,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In many ways Sunny Ratilal seems ahead of his time, with his mature knowledge of teamwork, building software and handling customers. Code mentors have made all the difference for him and his experiences highlight the importance of solid role models in the WordPress community.</p>\n<p>Though you may often feel like you&#8217;re working alone in your small corner of the world, the quality of the code you produce and your interactions with other developers may actually be mentoring future WordPress professionals. A developer who works to help others learn and grow can be instrumental in swinging the doors open for newcomers to the WordPress community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 22:11:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Matt: Shaer on Taibbi\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=43660\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2014/03/shaer-on-taibbi/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:200:\"<p><a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/matt-taibbi-on-wall-street-first-look-media.html\">Raging Against Hacks With Matt Taibbi</a>.

If you want the fonts to work over both SSL and non-SSL, you need to use the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808\" target=\"_blank\">protocol relative link</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re loading Google fonts from your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file, you might do it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">function mytheme_enqueue_styles() {\n            wp_register_style(\'googleFonts\', \'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Copse\');\n            wp_enqueue_style( \'googleFonts\');\n        }</pre>\n<p>However, this method breaks over HTTPS, which means that all your fancy custom fonts won&#8217;t work and the browser&#8217;s default will be loaded instead, ie. Times New Roman.</p>\n<p>Removing the &#8220;http&#8221; protocol from the link will allow the visitor&#8217;s browser to determine the correct protocol to load.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">function mytheme_enqueue_styles() {\n            wp_register_style(\'googleFonts\', \'//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Copse\');\n            wp_enqueue_style( \'googleFonts\');\n        }</pre>\n<p>There are many tutorials that claim to show you &#8220;The Right Way to Load Google Fonts in WordPress,&#8221; but most of them don&#8217;t use the protocol relative link. If you&#8217;ve ever forced SSL on pages then you know that all of your assets, including images, CSS, JS, fonts, etc., will be broken unless they are loaded via HTTPS. You should use the protocol relative links wherever possible when the assets or third-party links are available via both HTTP and HTTPS.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 06:19:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"WPTavern: Take The 2014 bbPress Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18954\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"http://wptavern.com/take-the-2014-bbpress-survey?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=take-the-2014-bbpress-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1652:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BuddyCampMiami2013.jpeg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18954]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BuddyCampMiami2013.jpeg\" alt=\"BuddyCamp Miami 2013\" width=\"194\" height=\"259\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18957\" /></a>Similar to BuddyPress, bbPress has <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/\" title=\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/\">announced its own survey</a> to help decide features and which direction bbPress development will go in 2014.

High quality CC-licensed images are incredibly easy to find these days. The vast majority of the collections include images that fall under the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 2.0 license</a>.

At first it seemed odd to me that they wouldn&#8217;t be compatible, given that they both offer so much freedom.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood explained why certain Creative Commons licenses are not compatible in <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/creative-commons-verses-gpl?replies=18#post-2981463\" target=\"_blank\">an answer</a> on the WordPress.org support forums:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Because CC-BY-SA cannot be sublicensed, then that means it cannot be distributed in a work under the terms of the GPL. So it cannot be included in a GPL-compatible work-as-a-whole.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to include images in a GPL-licensed work, you&#8217;ll need to select from those that fall under a <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses\" target=\"_blank\">compatible license</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0\" target=\"_blank\">GNU licensing classifications</a>, CC0 is the only Creative Commons license that is compatible with the GPL:</p>\n<blockquote><p>CC0 is a public domain dedication from Creative Commons. A work released under CC0 is dedicated to the public domain to the fullest extent permitted by law. If that is not possible for any reason, CC0 also provides a lax, permissive license as a fallback. Both public domain works and the lax license provided by CC0 are compatible with the GNU GPL.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are distributing a GPL-licensed product with images, such as a WordPress theme or plugin, your best bet is to opt for using images with the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/\" target=\"_blank\">CC0</a> or Public Domain license.</p>\n<h3>13 High Quality Sources for CC0 and Public Domain Licensed Images</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:CC0\" target=\"_blank\">CC0</a> and Public Domain licensed images are not as easy to find as those that fall under the CC 2.0 license. Nevertheless, I was able to locate 13 high quality sources for finding images that are suitable for inclusion in GPL-licensed works. All of the following sites explicitly state a Public Domain or CC0 license for the images collected.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://unsplash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://unsplash.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/unsplash1.jpg\" alt=\"unsplash\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18935\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/\" target=\"_blank\">PublicDomainPictures</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/publicdomainpictures.jpg\" alt=\"publicdomainpictures\" width=\"1280\" height=\"842\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18928\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://pixabay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://pixabay.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pixabay.jpg\" alt=\"pixabay\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18930\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://splitshire.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SplitShire</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://splitshire.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SplitShire.jpg\" alt=\"SplitShire\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18932\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.1millionfreepictures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1 Million Free Pictures</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.1millionfreepictures.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1millionfreepictures.jpg\" alt=\"1millionfreepictures\" width=\"1280\" height=\"850\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18934\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://viintage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Viintage</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://viintage.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vintage.jpg\" alt=\"vintage\" width=\"760\" height=\"598\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18936\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.gratisography.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gratisography</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gratisography.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gratisography.jpg\" alt=\"gratisography\" width=\"1280\" height=\"859\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18938\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://littlevisuals.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Visuals</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://littlevisuals.co/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/littlevisuals.jpg\" alt=\"littlevisuals\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18939\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.pdpics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PDpics</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pdpics.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pdpics.jpg\" alt=\"pdpics\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18941\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/\" target=\"_blank\">The British Library</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/britishlibrary.jpg\" alt=\"britishlibrary\" width=\"800\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18943\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://nos.twnsnd.co/\" target=\"_blank\">New Old Stock</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://nos.twnsnd.co/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/nos.jpg\" alt=\"nos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18945\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://pickupimage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pickup Image</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://pickupimage.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-lake-near-the-base-of-Copahue-volcano-031214D6BC845BA9.jpg\" alt=\"-A-lake-near-the-base-of-Copahue-volcano-031214D6BC845BA9\" width=\"960\" height=\"720\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18947\" /></a></p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://publicdomainarchive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Public Domain Archive</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://publicdomainarchive.com/\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/publicdomainarchive.jpg\" alt=\"publicdomainarchive\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18948\" /></a></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to bookmark these sites for the next time you&#8217;re building a WordPress theme or plugin for distribution on WordPress.org.

Specifically, the Matrix style Easter egg which appeared when a post revision was compared to itself. It wasn&#8217;t long after the discussion when plugins started showing up on the repository to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-matrix-easter-egg/\" title=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-matrix-easter-egg/\">disable it</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>A few days ago, Fred Myer of WPShout.com <a href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/\" title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/\">published his idea</a> to create a WordPress writing style guide. He describes how some error messages in WordPress are written tongue-in-cheek without providing any useful information as to why the error occurred. Take the default 404 error message in WordPress for example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is somewhat embarrassing, isn’t it? It seems we can’t find what you’re looking for. Perhaps searching can help.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing that WordPress couldn&#8217;t find what I was looking for and then proceeds to tell me that searching can help. Maybe a search should happen automatically with a list of results in the content area of the page? Regardless, it&#8217;s the wording of the message that rubs some people the wrong way. Myer advocates a more helpful approach:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When software breaks, it should not impose emotions, like an imaginary shared experience of embarrassment, on the user. It should explain what went wrong in as much detail as is helpful, and alert the user to any resources that may help address the problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Myer mentions the default post content in WordPress makes it seem trivial and cheap. He suggests the text should be eloquent and reflect the foundational mission of WordPress.</p>\n<p>The personality of WordPress runs deep. From core committ messages to hidden Easter eggs to the inclusion of Hello Dolly, WordPress is not your typical piece of boring software. According to Myer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Words have power: power to define new users’ impression of the seriousness of WordPress and its creators; power to alleviate users’ frustration or aggravate it; power to provide information or smugly withhold it. WordPress’s current written content sporadically disregards that power, making WordPress seem like a cheaper, more irritating, and less well-executed project than it really is.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a problem with WordPress&#8217; personality but if changes could be made so that translations are easier and error messages become helpful, I&#8217;d support them. Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/#comment-264374\" title=\"http://wpshout.com/wordpress-core-needs-writing-style-guide/#comment-264374\">commented on the article</a> and his remarks indicate that a change in WordPress’ wording isn’t likely.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WP has always been opinionated software with a lot of personality. Every year or two people try to neuter it, remove a bit of its soul, and sometimes it gets through. There are always convincing reasons, like this post, but it’s sad nonetheless. If anyone is going to stop using the software over these we probably didn’t create something very compelling in the first place. You could also create a “dry” localization of the software and see if it gets much traction.</p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_18909\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HowdyDoodyFeaturedImage.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18879]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/HowdyDoodyFeaturedImage.png\" alt=\"Howdy Doody Featured Image\" width=\"639\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18909\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23748404@N00/2292044151/\">A.Currell</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>No one is advocating for the demise of WordPress or telling people to stop using it over the howdy-doody verbiage within the software. There&#8217;s also not a mass exodus of people leaving the project over it. If anything, Myer&#8217;s article highlights the fact that WordPress can still be cute and funny as long as the verbiage is straight forward.</p>\n<p>I wonder how long the clash between software personality and straight forward thinking will continue? It&#8217;s been part of WordPress for years but WordPress has yet to cave in to the demands of the vocal minority. WordPress is being used on 20% of the web and continues to grow without showing any signs of slowing down. It&#8217;s not the end of the world if the verbiage of error messages and default post content are not changed but if they can be improved, then why not do it?</p>\n<h3>How To Help With The Style Guide</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to get involved with creating a WordPress writing style guide, <a href=\"http://wpshout.com/contact/\" title=\"http://wpshout.com/contact/\">get in touch with Fred Myer at fred at pressupinc.com</a>.

The prospect of building feature-rich, interactive stories within WordPress, without having to touch any code, was so promising that the project&#8217;s <a href=\"https://aesop.crowdhoster.com/storytelling-engine\" target=\"_blank\">Crowdhoster campaign</a> was <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/aesop-wordpress-storytelling-plugin-is-now-fully-funded\" target=\"_blank\">fully-funded</a> by the end of January.</p>\n<p>The buzz around the Aesop plugin proved that the art of storytelling is not dead. Publishers are eager to have more tools at their disposal to create stories that capture readers&#8217; attention. While Aesop brings a user-friendly implementation of storytelling features into the WordPress admin, the task of theming the plugin remained a real obstacle.</p>\n<p>Haskins had originally hoped to focus on the hosted version of Aesop after getting funded, but he temporarily scrapped that plan in favor of getting the plugin ready for showtime. Now that Aesop is available on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org</a>, Haskin&#8217;s team is moving full steam ahead to develop themes that will bring the plugin to life.</p>\n<h3>Genji: A Lean WordPress Theme With Just 2 Files</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji1.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18843]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji1-300x279.png\" alt=\"genji1\" width=\"300\" height=\"279\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18874\" /></a>The first official theme for Aesop is now in the wild. Inspired by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/\" target=\"_blank\">NY Times Snowfall</a>, the <a href=\"http://nickhaskins.co/products/genji/\" target=\"_blank\">Genji</a> theme was designed to load quickly and keep the spotlight on the story.</p>\n<p>Haskin&#8217;s team aimed for simplicity with their first product. <a href=\"http://aesopthemes.com/genji/\" target=\"_blank\">Genji</a> loads only two files. It includes a handful of options for uploading a logo and changing the background, text and link colors. All of the magic, however, is powered by the media that users add via the story engine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji2.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18843]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/genji2-300x192.jpg\" alt=\"genji2\" width=\"300\" height=\"192\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18876\" /></a>With the first product released, the  team is focusing on Jorgen, the next theme on deck for the story engine. Jorgen will incorporate the &#8220;cover&#8221; feature found on the Aesop Story Engine <a href=\"http://playground.aesopstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">demo site</a>. The development team has received many requests for the theme behind the story engine demo site and they are currently working on making that available to the public.</p>\n<p>All future Aesop themes will be sold on ThemeForest, as Haskins is now <a href=\"http://aesopstories.com/themes/the-release-of-genji/\" target=\"_blank\">partnering with Envato</a> to make it easy for consumers to find themes for the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 09:52:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Gravatar: Mobile Friendly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=503\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/13/mobile-friendly/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:540:\"<p>We just made the Gravatar.com website, blog, and all profile pages friendlier towards mobile devices.

If the visitor is not capable of inspecting the code with his browser, he might resort to a service built to automatically detect theme details. This has resulted in a proliferation of websites and browser add-ons that detect this information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://whattheme.com/\" target=\"_blank\">What Theme</a> is a new service that detects WordPress, Ghost and Shopify templates, even if the site is not using a commercial theme. For example, if you search WP Tavern, you&#8217;ll find that our site is using the Stargazer theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-example.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18827]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-example.jpg\" alt=\"what-theme-example\" width=\"768\" height=\"440\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18835\" /></a></p>\n<p>It does not yet reliably pick up on WordPress child themes, as I&#8217;ve discovered in this instance and a few others.</p>\n<h3>How What Theme Works</h3>\n<p>The engine itself is built on top of WordPress and in just a few weeks it has completed over 13,000 searches across over 4,000 unique sites. What Theme co-founder Jonny Schnittger gave us the details on how it works. &#8220;The current version of WhatTheme integrates with WordPress like a theme or plug-in would,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It gives us a lot of detail regarding what people are looking for and how successful they were.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When a user searches for a site, What Theme checks its existing catalog and if it finds it, the results are returned instantly. &#8220;In this scenario we attempt to identify the theme using several different methods,&#8221; Schnittger said. &#8220;At this point we also gather a bunch of other information that we are currently not surfacing/using).&#8221; Once the engine has found the name, it attempts to identify across various catalogs and sites. &#8220;Sometimes we get multiple matches,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this case we try and evaluate the best match and direct the user to it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When What Theme fails to identify a theme, Schnittger said they use various pattern matching algorithms to suggest themes from the same category, such as blog, portfolio, food, etc.</p>\n<p>For example, if you search for &#8220;WordPress.com,&#8221; the engine fails to match it to a theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-fail.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18827]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/what-theme-fail.jpg\" alt=\"what-theme-fail\" width=\"624\" height=\"432\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18845\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, What Theme also offers an option for the visitor to sign up to be emailed when the theme is found. It also funnels you to its <a href=\"http://whattheme.com/top-themes/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">top selections</a> for themes in the &#8220;blog&#8221; category, all of which are Themeforest items with the What Theme affiliate ID. In the future, Schnittger hopes to expand the suggestions, based on fonts, colors and layout.</p>\n<h3>What Theme Plans to Expand to a WordPress Installation and Customization Service</h3>\n<p>What Theme currently has basic support for Drupal and Joomla and plans to expand to include more CMS&#8217;s, such as ModX, DotNetNuke, Umbraco, etc. They are working to improve the accuracy of results for all supported platforms.</p>\n<p>Co-founder Catalin Zorzini let us in on some of their long-term goals. <strong>&#8220;We plan to become the go-to resource for web designers and developers being asked by friends and relatives to build a website for them on the cheap or for free,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;So instead of being forced to say no or to make empty promises, now they can just send them to whattheme.com and we&#8217;ll take care of the rest.&#8221; What Theme will then ask them what site they would like theirs to look like and recommend an existing template based on that. &#8220;The next step is to integrate it with a WP install and customization service,&#8221; Zorzini said.</p>\n<p>The What Theme site is another interesting take on services aimed at capitalizing on the millions of people searching for WordPress themes. Many services, such as <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/theme-friendly-helps-you-find-the-perfect-wordpress-theme\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Friendly</a>, are built around helping users shop for WordPress themes, with the primary monetization in the form of affiliate links.</p>\n<p>What Theme is different in that it hooks into the fact that the consumer has already located a theme that he likes.

I&#8217;ve noticed a lot of employees for WordPress agencies don&#8217;t seem to be sticking around with one company for very long. When I think of an employee staying at one company for a long time, I&#8217;m talking about three to five years although it&#8217;s easy to forget agencies like <a title=\"http://10up.com/\" href=\"http://10up.com/\">10up</a> have only been around for three years.</p>\n<p>Why does it seem like they are switching companies as if it&#8217;s no big deal? I sat back and pondered this question for a while and came up with the following conclusions.</p>\n<h3>Tons Of Employment Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Since WordPress powers 20% of the web, there are a multitude of employment opportunities.. If one company isn&#8217;t paying enough, chances are good that another company is. Of course, working for an agency isn&#8217;t required as sites like <a title=\"https://www.elance.com/\" href=\"https://www.elance.com/\">Elance</a> and <a title=\"https://www.odesk.com/\" href=\"https://www.odesk.com/\">oDesk</a> have proven there is high demand for individual freelancers who specialize in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Insight From A 6 Year Old WordPress Company</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WebDevStudiosLogo2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18689]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18760\" alt=\"WebDevStudios Logo \" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WebDevStudiosLogo2.png\" width=\"211\" height=\"64\" /></a>Founded in 2008, <a title=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\" href=\"http://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a> is one of the longest running WordPress development companies within the WordPress ecosystem. I asked co-owner Brad Williams what the attrition rate is for WebDevStudios. He told me very few employees have left the company since it was founded. He also told me they no longer hire contractors and every WebDevStudios employee is full-time.</p>\n<p>When asked if he&#8217;s seeing a lot of people apply for jobs at the company, he said &#8220;<em>We get quite a few applications when we post a job opening.</em>&#8221; Overall, Brad has seen a few remote employees bounce around, but doesn&#8217;t really consider it to be a widespread issue.</p>\n<h3>Switch Companies Without Ever Leaving Home</h3>\n<p>Remote WordPress employees have a distinct advantage over their physical workplace counterparts. They can switch companies without ever leaving home. Employees working in a physical location sometimes have to move to a different city for a promotion or for a new job. Remote workers can perform their jobs from anywhere in the world as long as they have an Internet connection. I think this is the single biggest reason remote workers can move between multiple companies within a one to two year timeframe.</p>\n<h3>Finding A Culture That Fits</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18689]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-10776\" alt=\"iThemes logo 2\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ithemeslogo2.jpg\" width=\"255\" height=\"53\" /></a>Thanks to remote workers not being tied to a physical location, it&#8217;s easier to find a company culture where they fit in. Automattic has done a great job of making sure every one of its employees blends in with its culture.</p>\n<p>For most companies, it&#8217;s not just about being an employee and getting work done. It&#8217;s about something larger than any one individual. When I&#8217;ve asked employees why they have switched between multiple companies within a year, the answer is usually the same. <em>It just wasn&#8217;t a good fit for me</em>.</p>\n<p>Glenn Ansley who works for <a title=\"http://ithemes.com/\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/\">iThemes</a> says his company does a great job keeping him connected to the company:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you don&#8217;t feel connected to your team, the loyalty is probably closer to that of a freelance contractor than an employee. My guess is it&#8217;s harder to get full buy-in / ownership from a remote employee. iThemes does a great job keeping me connected.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Not As Big Of A Problem As I Thought</h3>\n<p>After speaking with Cory Miller, Brad Williams, and Jake Goldman I&#8217;ve discovered the problem is not nearly as bad as I thought. Attrition rates for some of the largest, longest, running WordPress businesses are low and employees are sticking with them. However, for the reasons explained above, it&#8217;s easier to switch companies as a remote WordPress worker than a typical employee in a brick and mortar shop.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 21:23:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WP Inject Makes It Easy to Add Free Creative Commons Images to WordPress Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18778\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:220:\"http://wptavern.com/wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-inject-makes-it-easy-to-add-free-creative-commons-images-to-wordpress-posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5010:\"<p>Last week, Getty Images announced its new <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Creative/Frontdoor/embed\" target=\"_blank\">open-embed program</a>, which removes the watermark from many of the images in its library for non-commercial use. In exchange, Getty&#8217;s iframed images are plastered with its logo and force a row of large, unattractive social sharing buttons on each embed. Getty reserves the right to remove content from the embedded viewer at any time, which could potentially leave a trail of gaping black holes throughout your blog.</p>\n<p>Many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/07/photographers-getty-images\" target=\"_blank\">photographers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.poststat.us/getty-images-now-free-embed/\" target=\"_blank\">bloggers</a> are unimpressed with Getty&#8217;s implementation. Even with 35 million new &#8220;free&#8221; photos flooding the blogosphere, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons</a> images are likely to remain the preferred option, as they provide more creative freedom in styling the attribution and can be used in galleries, videos, design, etc.</p>\n<h3>WP Inject: A Homegrown Alternative to Getty&#8217;s Free Images</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inject/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Inject</a> is a new free plugin that makes it easy to use CC-licensed images in your WordPress content with just a few clicks. In fact, you don&#8217;t even need to leave the admin. The plugin adds a search box to the post editor. The search is hooked up to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr&#8217;s vast library of CC-licensed images</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18778]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject.png\" alt=\"wpinject\" width=\"1395\" height=\"1019\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18779\" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Inject lets you compare multiple keyword search results to find the best match. Adding an image to your content is as easy as clicking on the size you want. The plugin automatically places it within your content and adds the correct attribution. It also saves the image to your server.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18778]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wpinject2.png\" alt=\"wpinject2\" width=\"1244\" height=\"1110\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18782\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Designed for Blogger Convenience</h3>\n<p>WP Inject, although somewhat unfortunately named, does not fail to impress in the features department. Every aspect of the plugin was designed for the blogger&#8217;s convenience, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set the featured image for your post with a single click.</li>\n<li>Insert multiple images at once and create whole galleries.</li>\n<li>Sort by selected Creative Commons licenses.</li>\n<li>Choose between several image sizes easily.</li>\n<li>Modify the templates of WP Inject to change how images get displayed in your posts.</li>\n<li>Images are saved to your own server and added to the WordPress media library.</li>\n<li>Automatically populated ALT and title tags of the image for search engine optimization.</li>\n<li>Can use and insert your focus keyword set in WordPress SEO by Yoast for easier image search optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thomas Hoefter, the plugin&#8217;s developer, is also the author of the <a href=\"http://wprobot.net/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Robot</a> plugin and founder of <a href=\"http://cmscommander.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CMS Commander</a>. WP Inject is a side project that grew out of his personal need for a solution to add featured images to new posts as quickly as possible. He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Since I think finding good images for their posts is a problem lots of bloggers face, I have polished the plugin up last week and then released it. While there are a few alternatives out in the wild already (e.g. Photodropper), I found that most of them lacked features (at least some of which I needed) and/or are not actively updated anymore.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hoefter plans to update WP Inject regularly and created a website with a <a href=\"http://wpinject.com/tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a> on how to use the plugin. In the future, he intends to include more image sources in addition to Flickr. He also hopes to make it possible to inject other types of media, including videos, ads, products and news stories.</p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I found that the in-post search is fast and convenient, since you don&#8217;t have to leave the WordPress admin to locate images for your content. It keeps you in the flow while writing and removes the hassle of having to open more browser tabs to search. WP Inject is a solid alternative to Getty&#8217;s free images. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inject/\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a> the plugin for free from WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 18:34:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Alex King: Is WordPress the Right Tool for the Job?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://alexking.org/?p=19550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2014/03/12/when-to-use-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2752:\"<p>I recently got an email that asked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you ever question whether WordPress is the correct CMS for something?</p>\n<p>I am a big WordPress fan too and I&#8217;ve solved some really cool content management challenges with it but there are times when I think, this site would probably be faster and more efficient if it were built using some MVC framework?</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>With small business sites, this isn&#8217;t really that big a deal but with some of the enterprise-level clients you work with I wonder whether it becomes an issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rather than replying via email, I thought this might be a good topic for a blog post.</p>\n<p>First off, I should mention that when clients come to <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a>, it is often because they have already made a technology choice to use WordPress and have found us because of our reputation in working with WordPress. That said, we believe in using the right tool for the job.</p>\n<p>Most often that tool is WordPress, but there are times when we suggest alternative solutions that are a better fit for their specific problem. We&#8217;ve used our Oxygen MVC platform for a number of client projects, sometimes in conjunction with a WordPress powered site.</p>\n<p>One of the great benefits to using WordPress vs. a custom solution is that scaling WordPress is generally a solved problem. There are lots of smart folks who have figured this out and shared their knowledge within the community. We are very comfortable deploying high traffic sites on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Scaling a custom application is often a journey of discovery. Sometimes this journey can be a bit rocky, and lonely. You will need to solve most of your problems on your own. This makes WordPress a safer choice when all other things are equal.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m on record saying I don&#8217;t believe WordPress is a good general application platform, but I think it&#8217;s wonderful for certain types of apps. Our developer journal, <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/\">Capsule</a> is a great example of this. We created a distributed journal app that can sync back to a central server/hub &#8211; all on WordPress. I&#8217;ve also created an HR logging system using WordPress. These have worked quite nicely.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I believe in a pragmatic approach. The things that go into this decision include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comparing site needs to what WordPress does out of the box</li>\n<li>consider known and projected future enhancements</li>\n<li>consider potential scaling concerns</li>\n<li>consider the importance of the community and lack of vendor lock-in to the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happily, that means we choose WordPress much of the time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:08:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Alex\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: How To Prevent WordPress From Participating In Pingback Denial of Service Attacks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18691\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:226:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-prevent-wordpress-from-participating-in-pingback-denial-of-service-attacks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5274:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18691]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sucurilogo.png\" alt=\"SucuriLogo\" width=\"100\" height=\"34\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5763\" /></a>Security research firm Sucuri is reporting more than <a title=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/more-than-162000-wordpress-sites-used-for-distributed-denial-of-service-attack.html\" href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/03/more-than-162000-wordpress-sites-used-for-distributed-denial-of-service-attack.html\">162,000 WordPress sites were used</a> in a distributed denial of service attack.

The following code snippet will work correctly without any adverse effects. It disables pingbacks while allowing things like Jetpack and WordPress mobile apps to function normally. Add the code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\nadd_filter( \'xmlrpc_methods\', \'remove_xmlrpc_pingback_ping\' );\nfunction remove_xmlrpc_pingback_ping( $methods ) {\n   unset( $methods[\'pingback.ping\'] );\n   return $methods;\n} ;\n</pre>\n<h3>Is It Time For Pingbacks and Trackbacks To Go?</h3>\n<p>WPTavern is no stranger to denial of service attacks due to pingbacks and trackbacks. In 2010, I explained how <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wptavern-was-trackbacked-to-death\">WPTavern was trackbacked to death</a>. Shortly after the website came back online, I disabled both as I feared they might end up taking the site down again. A few years have gone by and I&#8217;ve re-enabled pingbacks and trackbacks with no ill effects. However, I wonder if it&#8217;s time to kill them once and for all, not just on WPTavern but in WordPress in general.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:06:38

It&#8217;s full of tiny improvements that improve the publishing experience, especially when it comes to editing content. You can now check it out first-hand, since 3.9 Beta 1 was released today. The official release is <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/version-3-9-project-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\">scheduled</a> to drop during the week of April 14th. Andrew Nacin <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2014/03/wordpress-3-9-beta-1/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the beta with the customary haiku, which nicely sums up what you&#8217;ll find in 3.9:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Lots of improvements<br />\nLittle things go a long way<br />\nPlease test beta one</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are some exciting new features coming in 3.9, but a good portion of core development has also been dedicated to iterating on features introduced in previous releases. Nacin summarized a few of the major new items that need testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to TinyMCE 4.0</li>\n<li>Widget customizer now rolled into core for live previews while managing widgets</li>\n<li>WP 3.8&#8242;s theme browsing experience extended to the theme installer</li>\n<li>Live preview for galleries in the editor &#8211; no more placeholder</li>\n<li>Drag-and-drop images directly onto the editor to upload</li>\n<li>Multiple improvements to image editing</li>\n<li>New audio/video playlists</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nacin asked WordPress users what they&#8217;re most excited about for WordPress 3.9 and here are a few responses from the community:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin\">@nacin</a> it\'s small, but i love the improvements to editing images and no more new windows. sometimes it\'s the little things.</p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/statuses/443468910806204416\">March 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin\">@nacin</a> Bringing external js libraries up to their current release versions? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23butimjustweird&src=hash\">#butimjustweird</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; George Stephanis (@daljo628) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daljo628/statuses/443468595360956417\">March 11, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin\">@nacin</a> the ability to position cropped images.

Install the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin and select &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies.&#8221; Alternatively, you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.9-beta1.zip\" target=\"_blank\">simply download the zip file for the beta</a>.</p>\n<p>If you think you&#8217;ve found a bug, feel free to post it on the<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\" target=\"_blank\"> Alpha/Beta forum</a>. That is the easiest entry point for testing the beta and being part of making it better. If you&#8217;re able to <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-bugs/\" target=\"_blank\">submit a bug</a> on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress core trac</a>, that&#8217;s even better.

This book is a much-needed resource for the BuddyPress community and could not have come at a better time.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress theming has evolved over the years but it has always had a steep learning curve. Part of the reason for this is that theming practices have been in flux as BuddyPress has improved. Contributors to the codex have worked hard to make sure the basics are in place but more in-depth tutorials tend to be scattered all over the web.</p>\n<p>Now that <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/\" target=\"_blank\">theme compatibility</a> is in place to allow BP to work with any WordPress theme, <a href=\"http://logicalbinary.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tammie Lister</a> decided that it was the right time to make a comprehensive guide. Lister is a long-time BuddyPress contributor who now works as a Theme Wrangler for Automattic. If you&#8217;re looking for an expert who will hold your feet to the fire when it comes to WordPress theming standards, Lister has you covered.</p>\n<h3>An Introduction to Basic WordPress Theming</h3>\n<p>One thing I appreciate about the book is that it does not assume the reader to already be an expert at WordPress theming. Lister takes a holistic approach and introduces the differences between social networking and building a community. While BuddyPress provides social networking features, building a community involves more than just activating the plugin and hoping people will use the site. Understanding the differences will help to shape the design process.</p>\n<p>She starts with the basics and provides a step-by-step guide for setting BuddyPress up on your server. She introduces theming by walking you through creating a child theme. You&#8217;ll learn all the basics, such as how to use your browser to inspect elements on the page in order to get the right selectors for making CSS changes.</p>\n<p>The book then moves into a basic introduction to WordPress theming before delving deeper into <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/themes/theme-compatibility-1-7/template-hierarchy/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress template hierarchy</a>. If you&#8217;re familiar with WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy\" target=\"_blank\">template hierarchy</a> then BuddyPress will come naturally, as it works the same way.</p>\n<h3>A Hands-On Guide to Creating BuddyPress Themes</h3>\n<p>With the theming basics under your belt, the next section puts you well on your way to building your own BuddyPress feature templates. This is necessary if you want to radically change the look of your community to customize it beyond the stock BuddyPress UI. Here&#8217;s where the hands-on fun begins. Lister walks the reader through building a sample responsive BuddyPress theme with unique elements, custom fonts, navigation menus, custom BuddyPress templates and more.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer who has just taken on a BuddyPress project for the first time and you&#8217;re new to BP theme development, this manual is a must-have. I highly recommend the process Lister uses for getting novice theme developers up to speed on the basics. You&#8217;ll go from installing BuddyPress to creating your very own theme in a short amount of time.

Be on the lookout for cleaner markup. Also try the new paste handling &#8212; if you paste in a block of text from Microsoft Word, for example, it will no longer come out terrible. (The &#8220;Paste from Word&#8221; button you probably never noticed has been removed.) It&#8217;s possible some plugins that added stuff to the visual editor (like a new toolbar button) no longer work, so we&#8217;d like to hear about them (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>). (And be sure to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">open a support thread</a> for the plugin author.)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve added <strong>widget management to live previews</strong> (the customizer). Please test editing, adding, and rearranging widgets! (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112\">#27112</a>) We&#8217;ve also added the ability to upload, crop, and manage header images, without needing to leave the preview. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21785\">#21785</a>)</li>\n<li>We brought 3.8&#8242;s beautiful new theme browsing experience to the <strong>theme installer</strong>. Check it out! (<a title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27055\">#27055</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Galleries</strong> now receive a live preview in the editor. Upload some photos and insert a gallery to see this in action. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26959\">#26959</a>)</li>\n<li>You can now <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> images directly onto the editor to upload them. It can be a bit finicky, so try it and help us work out the kinks. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19845\">#19845</a>)</li>\n<li>Some things got improved around <strong>editing images</strong>. It&#8217;s a lot easier to make changes to an image after you insert it into a post (<a class=\"closed\" title=\"View ticket\" href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24409\">#24409</a>) and you no longer get kicked to a new window when you need to crop or rotate an image (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21811\">#21811</a>).</li>\n<li>New <strong>audio/video playlists</strong>. Upload a few audio or video files to test these. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26631\">#26631</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. We&#8217;d love to hear from you! If you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/reports/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>.

Consider setting up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.9, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

There&#8217;s lots for you, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Please test your plugins and themes!</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff under the hood in 3.9 and we hope to blog a bit about them in the coming days. If you haven&#8217;t been reading the awesome <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/\">weekly summaries</a> on the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">main core development blog</a>, that&#8217;s a great place to start. (You should definitely follow that blog.) For now, here are some things to watch out for when testing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>load process in multisite</strong> got rewritten. If you notice any issues with your network, see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003\">#27003</a>.</li>\n<li>We now use the <strong>MySQL Improved (mysqli) database extension</strong> if you&#8217;re running a recent version of PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21663\">#21663</a>). Please test your plugins and see that everything works well, and please make sure you&#8217;re not calling <code>mysql_*</code> functions directly.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave</strong> was refactored, so if you see any issues related to autosaving, heartbeat, etc., let us know (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25272\">#25272</a>).</li>\n<li>Library updates, in particular Backbone 1.1 and Underscore 1.6 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/26799\">#26799</a>). Also Masonry 3 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25351\">#25351</a>), PHPMailer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25560\">#25560</a>), Plupload (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25663\">#25663</a>), and TinyMCE (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">#24067</a>).</li>\n<li>TinyMCE 4.0 is a <em>major</em> update. Please see TinyMCE&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x\">upgrade guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24067\">implementation ticket</a> for more.

Organized by Nathan Driver and a number of volunteers, the event was held on the campus of <a href=\"http://www.wright.edu/maps/facility/rike-hall\" title=\"http://www.wright.edu/maps/facility/rike-hall\">Wright State University within Rike Hall</a>. Other WordCamps I&#8217;ve attended on college campuses have gone well and this event was no exception.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Dayton Started As A Meetup</h3>\n<p>When I asked Driver how WordCamp Dayton started, he told me it began with their local meetup. After visiting WordCamps throughout the state of Ohio, he discovered many of the attendees were from Southwest Ohio and wanted an event closer to home. He created a meetup around the Dayton area to gauge interest. &#8220;<em>After a couple of months of debating we went for it and had our first MeetUp in October 2012&#8243;.</em> After managing the meetup for a couple of months, Driver noticed interest grew along with memberships which is when he decided to begin the process of creating a WordCamp.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>It begins. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcdayton&src=hash\">#wcdayton</a> opening remarks <a href=\"http://t.co/zHSUxnC1HG\">pic.twitter.com/zHSUxnC1HG</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Dustin Filippini (@dustyf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dustyf/statuses/442306845726633985\">March 8, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WordCamp Dayton was a two-day event with Friday featuring a beginners workshop. I was told around <strong>65</strong> people participated in the workshop where they were introduced to WordPress and learned about eCommerce as well as SEO. Saturday was dedicated to three different tracks of sessions covering publishers and users, power users, and developers.</p>\n<h3>New Event Filled With New Users</h3>\n<p>When Driver asked the audience how many of them were new to WordPress almost two-thirds of the room raised their hands. When he asked the audience if it was their first WordCamp, almost the same amount of hands were raised. Considering this was the first event of its kind in the area and so many people were new to WordPress, it&#8217;s impressive to see how many of them discovered and attended the event.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>Deep dive into WordPress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daytonwp\">@daytonwp</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcBenzak\">@MarcBenzak</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcdayton&src=hash\">#wcdayton</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/7nQEN4Si0S\">pic.twitter.com/7nQEN4Si0S</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Chris Celek (@ChrisCelek) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisCelek/statuses/442317759977115649\">March 8, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Cory Miller Delivers Inspirational Keynote</h3>\n<p>Cory Miller of <a title=\"http://ithemes.com/\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/\">iThemes.com</a> gave his <a title=\"http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/corymiller303/wordcamp-dayton-keynote\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/mobile/corymiller303/wordcamp-dayton-keynote\">keynote presentation</a> after lunch and it was filled with inspirational messages.

It takes drive, dedication, and a team of great volunteers. Driver told me one of the most challenging aspects of organizing the event was &#8220;<em>Finding the right individuals to have on the team and working with their schedule</em>&#8220;. While WordCamp is labeled a conference, it&#8217;s not the typical event people may be familiar with. As Driver told me, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s not about sitting in a room and listening to a speaker and moving on to the next one. It&#8217;s about providing a community environment.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I asked Driver what advice would he give to those organizing their first WordCamp:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Take your time. Contact everyone. Above all, have fun. As soon as you get the green light from <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\" title=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Central</a> go for it. Work through the tasks you think will be the most difficult first. Keep that momentum and keep going back to the reason why you wanted to have a WordCamp in your area. It&#8217;s not about you, it&#8217;s about the community. </p></blockquote>\n<h3>First Time Event Is A Flying Success</h3>\n<p>First time WordCamps usually have hiccups. While we did have a schedule change and had to switch rooms once to account for the number of people showing up to certain sessions, the rest of the event was perfect. The catered food was delicious, there was plenty of time for networking, and the location was just right. I commend and thank Nathan Driver along with all of his volunteers for helping make the first WordCamp Dayton such a success.

The event will be held in Sofia, Bulgaria on September 27–29. Sofia&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ndk.bg/\" target=\"_blank\">National Palace of Culture</a> will host WordPress fans from around the world. This beautiful venue is one of the largest convention centers in Southeastern Europe, with eight floors and three underground levels.</p>\n<p>In 2013, more than 700 attendees converged upon Leiden, the Netherlands for the <a href=\"http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">event</a>, which, by all accounts, was a smashing success. This massive undertaking was made possible by the efforts of a dedicated 50-person volunteer team.</p>\n<p>The first WordCamp Europe inspired the European WordPress community and caused them to come together in new ways. Jenny Beaumont, an attendee we <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-paris-2014-uniting-the-french-wordpress-community\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a>, remarked about how the event was transformative for the French WordPress community:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really feel that something special happened at WordCamp Europe back in October, something that inspired a momentum that we’re all still riding on today. People are coming together, opening up and crossing divides.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you want to keep your finger on the pulse of the European WordPress community, mark your calendar to attend WordCamp Europe 2014.

The best way to stay in touch with your user base is to subscribe to the support forums, since that&#8217;s the first place people generally go when looking for answers. Subscription options vary, depending on if it&#8217;s a plugin vs. a theme, so we&#8217;ll cover ways to keep yourself informed for each.</p>\n<h3>How to Subscribe to Plugin Support Forums</h3>\n<p>Plugins are fairly easy, because there&#8217;s a ready-made option for plugin authors who prefer email notifications for support forums. Scroll to the bottom of the support forum and you will find the option to subscribe via email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/plugin-support.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18617]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/plugin-support.jpg\" alt=\"plugin-support\" width=\"774\" height=\"175\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18622\" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, if you feel like your inbox is a dead end, you might make use of the RSS feed. Each plugin on WordPress.org has its own unique RSS feed. Plugin authors who have multiple works can subscribe to all of their plugins at once using this feed:</p>\n<pre>http://wordpress.org/support/rss/view/plugin-committer/yourusername</pre>\n<p>Given that RSS is the only option for subscribing to theme support forums, I&#8217;ll describe a few ways to utilize RSS below.</p>\n<h3>How to Subscribe to Theme Support Forums</h3>\n<p>Currently there is no option for subscribing to WordPress.org theme support forums by email. I checked with Samuel Wood (aka &#8220;Otto&#8221;), who works on the site, to find out if it&#8217;s something they will add. He said that it&#8217;s on the road map for the future.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, RSS is your only option, but it actually opens up many possibilities. RSS allows you to funnel data to yourself in different ways. If you want updates by email, you can easily sign up using a service like <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT</a> or <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/ http://blogtrottr.com/\">Blogtrottr</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ifttt.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18617]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ifttt.png\" alt=\"ifttt\" width=\"775\" height=\"296\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18624\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you want to be super militant about responding to support requests, you could set up an <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT</a> to route the RSS feed to SMS.</p>\n<p>Another option is set up an IFTTT recipe to channel RSS updates to an email that is specific for adding tasks to Evernote, Wunderlist, Asana, Remember The Milk or your favorite to-do app. Since both plugins and themes have RSS feeds, there many ways to put those feeds to work for you. Bypassing your inbox entirely may help you to be more organized and efficient in providing support for your plugins and themes.</p>\n<h3>Why It&#8217;s Important to Stay on Top of Support</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18634\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/origin_4900913730.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18617]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/origin_4900913730-300x300.png\" alt=\"photo credit: Open Kitchen España - cc\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18634\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/open-kitchen/4900913730/\">Open Kitchen España</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the time to commit to jump in on the forums as often as you&#8217;d like, notices routed to your inbox or to-do app will log those issues in the back of your mind. You&#8217;ll become more aware of areas where you might be able to improve plugin or theme documentation. The next time you get a rainy Saturday, you&#8217;ll already be poised to tackle potential issues that need updating in your themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Chances are that the reason you put your extension on WordPress.org was so that other people can use what you made. Staying on top of support will ultimately serve to make your users happier.

I perceived a problem of too much work (too many trac tickets, too many things needed testing), and too little knowledge (too few core members had the right knowledge of how to use trac / WordPress).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since that time, however, WordPress has added <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/\" target=\"_blank\">several new committers</a> and has made great strides in making contribution more accessible vai the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/\" target=\"_blank\">Core Contributors Handbook</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Overall, WordPress is a much friendlier place for contributors,&#8221;</strong> Payne said, which he attributed to the recent <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements\" target=\"_blank\">trac re-organization and refresh</a>, as well as the addition of new group leads to help facilitate communication and representation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PropsPress has been quietly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/propspress\" target=\"_blank\">tweeting</a> out props and publishing commit messages. &#8220;I was hoping to augment what WordPress was already doing with &#8216;recent rockstars&#8217; but on a more regular basis,&#8221; Payne said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where it would go, so I kinda let it bake.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>A New Direction for PropsPress</h3>\n<p>Payne is unsure as to whether PropsPress actually moved the needle to inspire more contributions to WordPress but he&#8217;s looking to use the website as a way to give back to the community. He&#8217;s got a few ideas to add stats tracking for all forms of WordPress contribution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Codex contributions, support in irc / forums, ticket contributions (gardening, testing), translations, monetary donations, etc. This is all in addition to the code contributions.  I think these would be fantastic to track.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, Payne would like to be able to show a range of individual stats, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of submitted patches</li>\n<li>Number of accepted contributions</li>\n<li>Number of ticket touches</li>\n<li>Pie chart of JS / PHP / HTML</li>\n<li>Pie chart of unit tests vs. core code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payne says the idea is more for recognition and encouragement than for competition. He has reservations about adding too much gamification. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">It can be dangerous to gamify it too much because then it can become less about the altruism and more about the game.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He hopes to backfill PropsPress to put each post in a tag for the users who are props&#8217;d so that the props would be queryable using WordPress taxonomies. Another interesting addition that he&#8217;d like to bring is a per-release total of &#8220;core committer code&#8221; vs &#8220;props code&#8221; in a stacked graph. &#8220;The hope is that the props code, in aggregate, is trending up!&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>One fun idea he has is to see WordPress identify &#8220;commit-anniversaries&#8221; and celebrate them, too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is easy to automate and is already celebrated on Twitter manually. Imagine if you woke up to &#8217;1 year ago, your code was pulled into WordPress 3.6. Thank you!&#8217; with a link to the ticket. That&#8217;s something you can retweet and that&#8217;s something that people can get excited about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some of these ideas have been included in past WordPress <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/28/contributor-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">community discussions</a> on WordPress stats, though it may not be possible to easily access this information at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Payne said that he would love to work on this project again but he needs help. &#8220;As you can tell, I have big vision and little time. Some suggestions from the leaders in the community would help set the direction.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Value of Knowing Where Contributions Come From</h3>\n<p>Payne believes that changes to PropsPress can help provide more information on where WordPress contributions come from, with the ultimate goal of improving the contribution experience. He poses a few examples:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What if WP knew that 90% of its code came from 10 people, and the other 10% came from 100 people &#8230; that&#8217;s good to know.  Or what if I told you that 80% of contributors were one-time contributors only?  That&#8217;s a totally made up number, but that type of metric is actionable. You can go find those one time contributors and do deep dives into their contribution experiences to find out why they aren&#8217;t contributing again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Payne is open to ideas and suggestions from the community to improve <a href=\"http://propspress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PropsPress</a>. What do you think about the concept of the site? Does it serve a valuable purpose?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:50:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Visualize WordPress Project Stats With Ohloh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18560\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"http://wptavern.com/visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6489:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-stats\" width=\"796\" height=\"369\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18589\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohloh</a> is an excellent resource for tracking open source projects and their contributions. The site allows you to search 10 billion lines of code and provides some fascinating data sets for OS projects, including <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> and many of its popular plugins.</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s analysis of &#8220;WordPress in a Nutshell&#8221; is based on the stats it was able to mine from the code and some in-house estimates. It provides an interesting perspective on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress has had <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary\" target=\"_blank\">25,085 commits</a> made by <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary\" target=\"_blank\">52 contributors</a> representing <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary\" target=\"_blank\">248,090 lines of code</a></li>\n<li>WordPress is mostly written in PHP with an average number of source code comments (as compared to other PHP projects in Ohloh)</li>\n<li>WordPress has a well established, mature codebase, maintained by a large development team with <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/factoids#FactoidActivityStable\" target=\"_blank\">stable Y-O-Y commits</a></li>\n<li>WordPress took an estimated <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost\" target=\"_blank\">64 years of effort</a> (COCOMO model) starting with its <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits?sort=oldest\" target=\"_blank\">first commit</a> in April, 2003, ending with its most recent commit about 4 hours ago</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the historical data provided about commits to the project, the assessment of the trends in recent activity is quite valuable to those working within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>Communicating &#8220;Free, Yet Priceless&#8221; Is Not Easy</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve built a business around providing WordPress development services, the insight provided here can help you articulate your confidence in the stability of the project for clients who are new to OS software. The notion of using software that is free to download may be off-putting to business owners who are used to judging value by dollars and time invested.</p>\n<p>Ohlo&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost\" target=\"_blank\">estimated cost</a> of WordPress is $3,488,557 with 63 person-years of effort, using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO\" target=\"_blank\">Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)</a>. While software cost estimation isn&#8217;t an exact science, especially for distributed open-source projects, a basic understanding of the COCOMO calculations provides an interesting perspective on WordPress&#8217; value. It also reveals the power of like-minded contributors working together toward a common goal.</p>\n<p>When you take into account the combined personnel attributes required to engineer and maintain a project of this size, there are few corporate entities that would have the budget to produce a project like WordPress in-house for their own development needs. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source software. Developers are happy to contribute to projects they believe in, and you can bank on people believing in the philosophy behind WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Visualize WordPress Lines of Code By Language</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary\" target=\"_blank\">languages summary</a> of the code base is of particular interest during a time when the WordPress community has been enthusiastically embracing <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-think-tank-panel-will-discuss-the-future-of-wordpress-on-feb-25th\" target=\"_blank\">dialogues</a> about its future. Ohloh offers a visual representation of WordPress lines of code by language:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress lines of code by Language\" width=\"954\" height=\"688\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18577\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress lines of code by Language</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that CSS and Javascript seem to parallel each other in terms of moderate growth over the years. PHP is still the fastest growing language in the code base, although WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg predicts that Javascript will someday make up the better part of its code. When speaking at <a href=\"http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2013</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TacoVerdo/status/386810803640209408\" target=\"_blank\">advice</a> to attendees was: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer today, learn as much JavaScript as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s graphs make it easy to visualize composite languages used in WordPress code and lets you toggle by year in order to further explore the data and follow the resulting trends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month-300x152.jpg\" alt=\"commits-per-month\" width=\"300\" height=\"152\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18587\" /></a>Even with Ohloh&#8217;s limited access to the project&#8217;s public data, it&#8217;s fascinating to see how it has been able to provide visuals for stats such as <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary\" target=\"_blank\">commits per month</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary\" target=\"_blank\">contributors per month</a>.</p>\n<p>It would be awesome if some day WordPress.org could display more stats related to its code and contributions, which would undoubtedly provide some more meaningful data on other aspects of the project as a whole.

They&#8217;re called Quicktags and WordPress supports them out of the box via the <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API\">Quicktags API</a>. Quicktags provide the same type of buttons you&#8217;d see when writing a post in the Text editor of WordPress. Bonus points to theme authors who style the tags to match the rest of the theme.</p>\n<h3>Comments Of The Third Party Kind</h3>\n<p>The first thing I do after I read an article is read the comments if they&#8217;re available. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly rare to see popular sites powered by WordPress using the native comment system. Most of the comment forms I see look like this.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18509\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18509\" alt=\"Comments by disqus\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus-500x420.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"420\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Comments by disqus</p></div>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t like seeing two columns of related content underneath the current conversation. I find it confusing to figure out where a conversation ends. The bottom line is more and more sites are turning to third party comment systems because of the features they have out of the box.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Tried With IntenseDebate</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18513\" alt=\"IntenseDebate Comment Form\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm-500x343.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">IntenseDebate Comment Form</p></div>\n<p><a title=\"http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/\" href=\"http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/\">Acquired in September of 2008</a> by Automattic, <a title=\"http://www.intensedebate.com/\" href=\"http://www.intensedebate.com/\">IntenseDebate</a> was one of many commenting services launched that year including <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>, <a href=\"http://sezwho.com/\">SezWho</a>, and <a href=\"http://js-kit.com/\">JS-Kit</a>. IntenseDebate had some cool features for comments at the time such as threaded comments and reply by email. Fast forward six years later and IntenseDebate is now on hiatus. This was confirmed by Matt Mullenweg when we interviewed him on <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\">episode 130 of WordPress Weekly</a>.</p>\n<p>When I asked him about the status of IntenseDebate, he replied &#8220;<em>IntenseDebate is currently on hold. It&#8217;s not actively being worked on inside Automattic. But there has been a lot of work on the Jetpack comment features such as subscriptions and interactions with social networks.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also mentioned WordPress hasn&#8217;t done a lot of things to improve areas that are user facing such as comments. The last major improvement to comments was the addition of threaded comments in <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/\">WordPress 2.7 &#8216;Coltrane&#8217;</a>. He explained, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s very difficult to iterate comments as it&#8217;s hard to get those changes to be compatible with every WordPress theme in the world.</em>&#8221; He mentioned the possible use of API&#8217;s and ended his answer with &#8220;<em>the most interesting things happening with comments are services and Automattic&#8217;s work with Jetpack Comments.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Jetpack Powered Comments</h3>\n<p>I think it’s quite telling that WordPress.com doesn’t use IntenseDebate. Instead, it uses a custom comment system that supports using credentials from four major social media services. <strong>WordPress.com, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+</strong>. If you use Jetpack, you can use the same comment system by activating the <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\">Jetpack Comments</a> module.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18512\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18512\" alt=\"Jetpack Comment Form\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm-500x289.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jetpack Comment Form</p></div>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with Jetpack Comments is it&#8217;s not easily extendable using various comment plugins. Or, not many plugins are compatible with Jetpack Comments. At least with IntenseDebate, there is a <a title=\"http://intensedebate.com/plugins\" href=\"http://intensedebate.com/plugins\">library of plugins</a> to add features on top of what the service already offers. Since Jetpack Comments is tied to a plugin, it&#8217;s not platform agnostic like IntenseDebate.</p>\n<h3>The Future Of Comments In WordPress Is Unclear</h3>\n<p>Between Jetpack comments and IntenseDebate, it&#8217;s unclear what the future holds for the native comment system in WordPress. There have been multiple discussions around the topic of removing comments from core and putting them into a plugin but the idea hasn&#8217;t gained traction.</p>\n<p>My hope is that native WordPress comments will continue to improve to the point where using a third party is counter-productive. I want to see WordPress make it as easy as possible to contribute to conversations on the web. When Matt Mullenweg <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\">published the announcement</a> of acquiring IntenseDebate on his blog in 2008, he said the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope he still feels that way about comments and will strive to improve that area of WordPress sooner, rather than later.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<p>I encourage everyone to read <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate\">this blog post</a> from July 2, 2013 where Erlend Sogge Heggen wrote a post on how Automattic is losing the debate. It&#8217;s a detailed article that talks about IntenseDebate, Automattic, and commenting in WordPress in general. Also worth reading is the discussion that followed in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 14:00:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress and bbPress Websites Are Now Open Source: Contributions Welcome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2188:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18506]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers-300x225.png\" alt=\"buddypress-wallpapers\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16152\" /></a>The code that powers the <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress.org</a> and <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress.org</a> websites is now open source. John James Jacoby, the lead developer for the projects, announced that all of the custom code used on these sites is now available in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/buddypress.org/public_html/wp-content\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Subversion repository</a>.</p>\n<p>If you browse the repository, you&#8217;ll notice that the trunk has a BuddyPress.org directory but no bbPress directory. In Jacoby&#8217;s <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on bbPress.org, he explained that the bbPress website is actually part of BuddyPress.org&#8217;s WordPress installation and they share some of the same code.</p>\n<p>Open sourcing the code for these sites makes it possible for the community to take a more active role in contributing to improvements. Jacoby hopes that contributors will be enthusiastic about working together to bring new design, features, and direction to the websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’re now able to checkout, review, and patch the code that makes BuddyPress.org happily hum along. This is exciting for a few obvious reasons (like security, and really putting our open source philosophies where our code is) but the one I’m most excited about is it takes enhancements to the site out of our hands, and potentially puts them into yours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His post was essentially an open invitation to the bbPress and BuddyPress communities. Now it&#8217;s possible for anyone to jump in and contribute using the same workflow that you&#8217;ve used for contributing to bbPress and BuddyPress software in the past. What would you like to change or add to the project sites?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 08:57:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: SXSW Anti-Parties\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=43656\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"http://ma.tt/2014/03/sxsw-anti-parties/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"<p>I have a few quotes and thoughts in the WSJD article <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304732804579423482598869054\">At Lavish SXSW Festival, Some Avoid Marketing Circus</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 06:47:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WP Blackberry: Calling All Mobile Developers!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/?p=729\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/2014/03/06/were-hiring/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1231:\"<p>Are you passionate about mobile development?

Two weeks ago, Daniel Bachhuber opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27192\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> proposing that WordPress instruct users to change their passwords when sending new account emails.</p>\n<p>When a user is added to a multisite network and has activated his account, WordPress sends out an email that includes the new password:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18488]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg\" alt=\"multisite-new-user\" width=\"645\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18491\" /></a></p>\n<p>Several text changes were proposed for the email to urge users to change their passwords after logging in.  After a brief discussion during yesterday&#8217;s core development meeting, Andrew Nacin moved the issue to the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/users/login-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">Login and Registration</a> component.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to skip this entirely for 3.9,&#8221; Nacin said. He highlighted the reasons why the incremental improvements in the proposed patches don&#8217;t solve the issue, given that they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only apply to multisite (emails are sent in plain text for new user registrations in single-site too)</li>\n<li>Only apply for the fallback email template (these are editable in multisite)\n<li>Don&#8217;t do anything in the dashboard to nag the user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nacin proposed that the core team tackle the issue for WordPress 4.0 in a way that will clearly improve the user experience.

As of WordPress 3.8, theme authors have the ability to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/26352\" target=\"_blank\">customize defaults</a> when adding custom background support. For example, you can set a default for any of the following <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS background properties</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>background-color</li>\n<li>background-image</li>\n<li>background-repeat</li>\n<li>background-attachment</li>\n<li>background-position</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oftentimes users want their sites to look similar to the demo, but they may be unaware of how to adjust the background properties to achieve that. It&#8217;s nice to have some defaults in place so that the theme looks similar to the demo right out of the box, without any adjustments.</p>\n<p>Depending on the background image that you select, it can be advantageous to set its defaults to the most sensible display for that image. For example, if your default background is an image that&#8217;s meant to tile, you want it displayed like that after the user activates the theme.</p>\n<p>Adding custom background support to the customizer is done through your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_theme_support( \'custom-background\' );</pre>\n<p>From here you can further customize the background properties by adding default arguments. Usually themes add custom background support to a setup function with other customizer options. Here&#8217;s a quick example of setting a default background to no-repeat, centered position with fixed attachment.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function yourtheme_setup() {\n	add_theme_support(\n		\'custom-background\',\n		array(\n			\'default-color\' =&gt; \'2d2d2d\',\n			\'default-image\' =&gt; get_template_directory_uri() . \'/images/background.jpg\',\n			\'default-repeat\'     =&gt; \'no-repeat\',\n			\'default-position-x\' =&gt; \'center\',\n			\'default-attachment\' =&gt; \'fixed\',\n\n		)\n	);\n}\nadd_action( \'after_setup_theme\', \'yourtheme_setup\' );\n</pre>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in the customizer by default after the user installs the new theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18114]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg\" alt=\"background-customizer\" width=\"874\" height=\"584\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18475\" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, the user can still adjust these properties through the customizer to suit their own custom background images. The defaults simply ensure that the packaged background image looks nice when the theme is activated for the first time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 21:27:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"bbPress: Open Sourcing bbPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://bbpress.org/?p=143352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1054:\"<p>Pssst&#8230; want to know a secret?

By the time it had, requests for what software the website was running on were already coming into the forums. It wasn&#8217;t just BuddyPress people were asking for, it was the theme powering the site, the extra little plugins we were running to trick it out, and just general curiosity about what we were doing to make things go.</p>\n<p>In October of 2012, the core teams started the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta Blog</a> which lead us towards releasing bits of WordPress.org code for peer review over on the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org\">Meta Trac</a>. Since then, we&#8217;ve simplified BuddyPress.org&#8217;s codebase to make reviewing it and extending it really easy, and we are excited to announce today that <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/buddypress.org/public_html/wp-content\">all of the custom code is now publicly available</a> in the Meta Subversion repository.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re now able to checkout, review, and patch the code that makes BuddyPress.org happily hum along.

I was having problems with a plugin, which started misbehaving. The plugin had previously worked fine (it generates a sidebar widget), and I wasn&#8217;t actively working on my site, so I wasn&#8217;t really sure when it had quit working.</p>\n<p>In the course of debugging the problem, I discovered that the plugin was throwing warnings in my PHP error log regarding the <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> function. As a quick fix, I simply replaced all of those calls with WordPress&#8217; <code>esc_sql()</code> function. Voila, problem fixed.</p>\n<p>Curious, I took a peek into <code>wp-db.php</code>, and found this block of code:</p>\n<pre><code>\n/* Use ext/mysqli if it exists and:\n *  - USE_EXT_MYSQL is defined as false, or\n *  - We are a development version of WordPress, or\n *  - We are running PHP 5.5 or greater, or\n *  - ext/mysql is not loaded.\n */\nif ( function_exists( \'mysqli_connect\' ) ) {\n        if ( defined( \'USE_EXT_MYSQL\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = ! USE_EXT_MYSQL;\n        } elseif ( version_compare( phpversion(), \'5.5\', \'&gt;=\' ) || ! function_exists( \'mysql_connect\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        } elseif ( false !== strpos( $GLOBALS[\'wp_version\'], \'-\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Note the bit about using a development version of WordPress. In my case, I&#8217;m running out of svn trunk, and my server has the <code>mysqli</code> extension installed, so <code>wpdb</code> chose to use it. That&#8217;s fine.</p>\n<p>But this exposes the fact that some plugins use functions like <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> &#8220;in the raw&#8221;, so to speak, which depends on using PHP&#8217;s <code>mysql</code> extension, and not <code>mysqli</code>. WordPress provides convenience functions like <code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/esc_sql\">esc_sql</a>()</code> and <code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#Protect_Queries_Against_SQL_Injection_Attacks\">$wpdb-&gt;prepare()</a></code> to help abstract details like this away and protect developers against environmental differences between servers.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will save somebody else out there some debugging time.</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/06/mysql-vs-mysqli-wordpress/\">mysql vs mysqli in WordPress</a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org\">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p><div class=\"yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none\">\n<img src=\"http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130\" alt=\"YARPP\" />\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 17:30:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Dougal Campbell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Official Gravatar Mobile App In The Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:146:\"http://wptavern.com/official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1612:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18451]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18453\" alt=\"Gravatar Logo 2\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png\" width=\"239\" height=\"63\" /></a>Toni Schneider, <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\">who recently switched positions</a> with Matt Mullenweg inside Automattic has <a title=\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/\" href=\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/\">asked on the Gravatar blog</a>, <em>Which platform should a Gravatar app be released for first?</em>.

It includes some incremental bugfixes since 2.5.9, plus some security and anti-spam improvements to how pingbacks work. Key changes since the last release:  Optimize javascript and add localization support. Fix bug in link to spam comments from right now dashboard widget. Fix bug with deleting old comments to avoid timeouts dealing with large volumes of comments. Include X-Pingback-Forwarded-For header in outbound WordPress pingback verifications. Add a pre-check for pingbacks, to stop spam before an outbound verification request is made.  There was a news cycle a few days ago about “WordPress pingbacks being used to DDOS sites” which had a lot of misinformation and hyperbole, but there were two valid issues which the last two bullet points address: anti-spam checks were done after a pingback was verified, and WP didn’t pass on who made the request that caused it to verify a pingback (effectively cloaking the true source). This update to Akismet addresses both, and we think a similar approach may be appropriate for core in a future release.

I’ve helped put the meeting together since 2009. Usually, we’ll have 10-25 people show up depending on the weather or if the event is on a holiday. Meetups are like a smaller version of WordCamps where individuals present on specific topics each month. Now that we have a healthy nucleus of regular attendees, the meetups almost run themselves. Using Meetup.com To Start A Meetup A Lot Of Meetups Happening In My Area I recently saw someone ask how they can start a WordPress meetup. They lived in a city with a population of 75,000 people and according to Meetup.com, a WordPress group didn’t exist in their area. Launched in 2002, Meetup.com is the most popular website for getting people with like-minded ideas together. The site has meetups for any topic under the sun. Meetup organizers need to pay organizer dues before the meetup can be established on the site. Meetup.com has three pricing plans available and each plan allows you to run up to three separate meetups.  $12 a month for 6 months (a single $72 charge) $15 a month for 3 months (a single $45 charge) $19 per month  The WordPress foundation has a program in place that will pay membership dues so long as the group follows a few guidelines. In a nutshell:  WordPress meetups are for the benefit of the local community and are not to be used primarily for business purposes. The WordPress and WordCamp trademarks should be respected. The meetup should foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.  If you’re organizing a WordPress meetup solely for the purpose of meeting potential clients, you’re missing the point of what a community organized event is. Try Not To Start A Meetup Alone If possible, try to find one or two other people in your local area interested in having a WordPress meetup. In 2009, I asked on Twitter  if anyone in the North East Ohio area would be interested in attending a WordPress meetup. I discovered Brian Layman who is a respected WordPress developer was just a short drive away from me as was Kim Parsell and Jeff Lee. I coordinated with them over Twitter and email to establish the core meetup group. Once we had a small dedicated group of individuals attending the meetup, we used our collective social media presence to announce and recruit interested members to the meetup. Keep in mind Meetup.com will notify registered users in the area when a new meetup is created that matches their interests. Also consider using the WordPress.org Meetup Forum to tell others about the meetup. Brian Layman Sharing Knowledge I was lucky to have two to three people help me kick-start our meetup. If you can’t find attendees on Twitter or Facebook, try attending meetups in your area that are similar to WordPress. For instance, meetups on web design, content management, SEO, etc. will likely have a few WordPress people in attendance. Finding A Venue Finding a venue to host a meetup can be difficult. I recommend a place that has good WiFi, is somewhat quiet and set up for presentations. Co-working spaces are a great option to host a meetup since most of them contain the amenities I’ve outlined above. They have the side benefit of sometimes hosting workers that have an interest in WordPress. If you end up using a co-working space, ask around to see if anyone has an interest in WordPress. They could be your newest members to your meetup! Immediately Establish Consistency One of the biggest lessons learned while organizing a meetup is how important it is for the event to happen consistently at the same time. In the past, our meetup didn’t have a specific day of the month and was created when we felt like meeting up. This left people questioning whether or not there would be another meetup the following month. Make Your Meetup Predictable By immediately establish consistency, you’re giving attendees a chance to plan around your meetup. For example, ours is held on the fourth Thursday of every month. The only time it changes is during inclement weather or during a holiday. It’s important you communicate schedule changes as soon as possible to give attendees a chance to change their plans. How Long Should The Meetup Be? You don’t need to have a time limit unless the venue requires you to leave at a certain time. Our meetup is typically two hours long with the first hour dedicated to a topic. Topics are decided either from the previous meeting or from users in our meetup.com group. If you’re thinking about doing a presentation at a WordCamp, meetups are an excellent opportunity to hone your skills. Presenting in front of 15-30 people is less stressful than a room of 50-100. WordCamps Usually Start As Meetups First When I asked Nathan Driver how WordCamp Dayton, Ohio started, he told me it began with their local meetup. After visiting WordCamps throughout the state of Ohio, he discovered many of the attendees were from Southwest Ohio and wanted an event closer to home. He created a meetup around the Dayton area to gauge interest. “After a couple of months of debating we went for it and had our first MeetUp in October 2012″. After managing the meetup for a couple of months, Driver noticed interest grew along with memberships which is when he decided to begin the process of creating a WordCamp. Starting A Meetup Is Not Hard But Requires Work and Dedication Meetups require dedication and consistency to develop a community of their own. Don’t be discouraged if only three to five people show up. Use your meetup.com page as a hub and encourage attendees to leave feedback after every meeting. Make sure communication channels are open between the organizer and the attendees so everyone within the group is on the same page. Last but not least, have fun. Meetups don’t have to be serious and in my opinion, shouldn’t be. They are informal gatherings of people from all backgrounds united by an interest in WordPress.  If you have any suggestions for new WordPress meetup organizers, please add them in the comments.\'>WPTavern: Guide To Starting And Maintaining A WordPress Meetup</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=treehouse-expands-wordpress-education-to-include-buddypress-beginners-course\' title=\'Just one month after launching its WordPress beginner’s course, Treehouse has added BuddyPress education to its collection of interactive learning resources. The “Learn BuddyPress” course is geared toward BuddyPress beginners and covers all the basics of setup, user management, and core social components.  After reviewing the course, I was impressed by how quickly Gordon is able to communicate all the basics for gaining competence with BuddyPress, including the following:  Getting Started With BuddyPress: How to Install BP and configure its settings, register users and use the codex BuddyPress Member Profiles: Setting up extended profile user fields, members page, status updates, etc. Social Interactions in BuddyPress: Friend connections, private messaging, mentioning users, notifications, activity, groups Customizing BuddyPress: BP plugins, themes and customizations  Each component is covered in great detail from both a user and community manager perspective. If you learn best by watching videos, then this course may be a good option for you, as it also includes an accompanying video transcript for each section. The lessons include links to the BuddyPress codex for further reference on the topics discussed. Treehouse Plans to Add More BuddyPress Education Resources Zac Gordon, Treehouse’s instructor for the course, said that they’ve been experiencing an increase in demand for BuddyPress education resources. He plans to create a BuddyPress Theme Development course to follow and may add a plugin development course sometime further down the road. With Treehouse’s expansion into resources for major WordPress plugins, I asked him if other extensions will be featured. “bbPress is definitely on my radar, although I’ve had no requests for it,” Gordon said. “Jetpack would be a cool idea too, since we just did the WordPress.com course.” He’s currently experimenting with different course lengths and may produce a quick Jetpack resource within the next month or two. The Learn BuddyPress course is the first of its kind with in-depth video tutorials for every aspect of using BuddyPress. This is a great resource for teaching yourself the basics of BuddyPress over a weekend. The course is also a high quality option for BuddyPress developers to recommend to clients for basic support on how to use BuddyPress’ core features.\'>WPTavern: Treehouse Expands WordPress Education to Include BuddyPress Beginners Course</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wordpress.tv/2014/03/17/chris-lema-wordcamp-las-vegas-2013-opening-keynote/\' title=\'    \'>WordPress.tv: Chris Lema: WordCamp Las Vegas 2013 Opening Keynote</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=10up-hires-ceo-to-help-take-company-to-the-next-level\' title=\'WordPress development agency 10up has hired John Eckman to take on the role of CEO. Eckman will work closely with Goldman and team leaders on the day-to-day operations of the company. Jake Goldman will remain as president and will focus on the products, strategic investments, and business development side of the company. Eckman has spent the last 15 years in the CMS ecosystem with five different companies both in the open-source and non open-source space. Before 10up, he worked for iSite Design, a company that has a portfolio filled with companies from start-ups to non-profits to fortune 25 industry leaders. Removing Obstacles To Enable More Efficient Employees In the short-term, Eckman will observe how the company functions, locate growing pains and determine any obstacles he can remove to help employees become more efficient. Sometimes, a hiring like this can lead to immediate and drastic changes but Eckman wants the transition to be as smooth as possible. He doesn’t want to change the company culture if it’s working. Longer term, he wants to “Make the team as efficient as possible. Remove non-productive frustrations and empower employees to be as productive as possible“. Executing The Vision The hiring enables 10up to continue growing and to take on bigger projects. However, Eckman noted he wants to see the company continue to take on smaller more nimble projects. The goal is to have a wide-ranging portfolio showcasing the strengths of the company no matter how small or large the project. When I asked Eckman to summarize his position in the company, he said, “Jake will drive the vision, I’ll execute it“.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

I have served as an attorney in countless criminal and DWI / DUI matters with full control of initial investigations, trial planning, motions, discovery, legal research and courtroom appearances and trials.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed forensic evidence regarding arson investigations, developing a theory of litigation based on that analysis and have cross examined many police officers, detectives, expert witnesses including arson and explosives experts, electronic experts, ballistics experts, police laboratory chemists, physicians and psychologists.\r\n\r\nI have successfully litigated and argued many pre-trial motions to suppress evidence based on probable cause to stop and frisk and violations of the defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In 2009 I served as the Municipal Prosecutor in the  large Bergen County municipality of Fair Lawn. I was reappointed to that position for 2010 and 2011. I was appointed by the Mayor and Counsel of  Municipality Fair Lawn to serve as the alternate Public Defender in 2012, 2013 and 2014.\r\n\r\nMy New York defense practice areas and experience include:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>DWI / DUI</li>\r\n	<li>Driving Under the Influence of Drugs</li>\r\n	<li>Marijuana Refusal Hearings</li>\r\n	<li>Driving While Suspended</li>\r\n	<li>Marijuana Possession Marijuana Sale</li>\r\n	<li>Identity Theft</li>\r\n	<li>Credit Card Fraud</li>\r\n	<li>Insurance Fraud</li>\r\n	<li>Drug Possession</li>\r\n	<li>Drug Sale</li>\r\n	<li>Conspiracy Charges</li>\r\n	<li>Assault</li>\r\n	<li>Domestic Violence</li>\r\n	<li>Gun Possession</li>\r\n	<li>Gun Use</li>\r\n	<li>Robbery</li>\r\n	<li>Burglary</li>\r\n	<li>Sex Crimes</li>\r\n	<li>Murder</li>\r\n	<li>Attempted Murder</li>\r\n	<li>Grand Larceny</li>\r\n	<li>Receiving Stolen Property</li>\r\n	<li>Petit Larceny</li>\r\n	<li>Menacing</li>\r\n	<li>Criminal Mischief</li>\r\n	<li>Trespass</li>\r\n	<li>Shoplifting</li>\r\n	<li>Speeding Cases</li>\r\n	<li>Red Light Violations</li>\r\n	<li>Criminal Record Expungements</li>\r\n	<li>Leaving the Scene of an Accident</li>\r\n	<li>Probation Violations</li>\r\n	<li>Parole Violations</li>\r\n	<li>Felonies</li>\r\n	<li>Misdemeanors</li>\r\n	<li>Wrongful Arrest</li>\r\n	<li>Excessive Use of Force</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI am a member of the following professional organizations: New York State Criminal Bar Association, New York State Bar Association, American Bar Association, New Jersey State Municipal Prosecutors’ Association, Bergen County Bar Association.', 'About Us', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'about-us', '', '', '2014-03-18 05:55:49', '2014-03-18 05:55:49', '', '0', 'http://carlspector.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/?page_id=1139', '0', 'page', '', '0');

These arrests fall under New York Felony DWI DUI Penalties.\r\n\r\nOther issues that can have a major impact on whether you’re convicted for DUI in New York, is whether breath, blood, or urine testing was done after the arrest – and were the results over the legal limit?  If they were, that’s were an experienced NY DWI attorney can make all the difference in the world.\r\n\r\nWe’ve put together much more detailed information about New York DWI testing and specific legal defenses we utilize in court at our New York DWI Testing and legal defense pages.  Why not take a minute or two and get your questions answered about blood tests, urine tests and breath tests.\r\n\r\n<strong>Driving Privileges…. The Most Important Issue For Many Of Our Clients</strong>\r\n\r\nOver the years, there’s one thing we’ve learned – for most of our clients, being able to drive as soon as possible after an arrest for DWI in New York is extremely important.\r\n\r\nIn this state, there’s no way around the law – when you are arrested and charged with DWI, and you refused to take a chemical test to determine your Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)… your license is suspended right there at your arraignment.\r\n\r\nYour drivers license can then be revoked for at least one year after a hearing by the Department of Motor Vehicles.\r\n\r\nAgain, for this type of situation, it really is on your best interest to get the very best DUI attorney you can find.\r\n\r\n<strong>How We Can Help</strong>\r\n\r\nFacing a DWI charge is stressful. We promise to help you through the entire process, resolve any concerns you have, and answer all your questions.  It is our duty to provide you with expert advice, guide you through the legal process, and represent you in the courtroom.\r\n\r\nEarlier on this page, I said you were going to need smart and professional legal representation.  We’d like to be the New York DWI attorneys you call for that help.\r\n\r\nWhy not pick up the phone and call us for a FREE consultation.  We’re available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\r\n\r\nIn the <strong>NYC area and Long Island</strong>, call us at 212 683 5912.\r\nFor <strong>WNY &amp; Upstate NY</strong>, call 1 800 879 6410.\r\nIf the call is <strong>long distance</strong>, or you <strong>live elsewhere in the state</strong>, call us for free at 1 800 879 6410.\r\n\r\nWe won’t pressure you – we’ll just answer your questions.\r\n\r\nIf we work together to solve your legal problem…. great.  If not, that’s okay too.\r\n\r\nWhy not put former prosecutors to work for you on your DWI arrest.  We have a very strong track record of success throughout the State of New York, and we can certainly help with your DWI in New York – <strong>regardless of where you live.</strong>', 'New York DWI Overview', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'dwi-defense', '', '', '2014-03-18 06:00:12', '2014-03-18 06:00:12', '', '0', 'http://carlspector.laptoppricesinpakistan.com.pk/?page_id=1142', '0', 'page', '', '0');

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

While there are other circumstances that can lead to felony charges involving a DWI / DUI, this is the most common.</li>\r\n	<li>Where the DWI / DUI itself is a misdemeanor but the driver is charged with some other felony, like vehicular manslaughter if someone is killed.</li>\r\n	<li>It is now a class “E” felony to drive while intoxicated with a child 15 years of age or younger in the car. In addition, if the defendant is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of the child in the vehicle, the police MUST file a report with Child Protective Services (CPS).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nFelony DWI in New York is much more serious than Misdemeanor DWI, and includes the possibility of state prison time. In New York’s court system, these more serious criminal cases are mostly handled in the higher level courts – Misdemeanors stay in the Criminal Courts, while most of the substantive work in a felony is done in the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nFelony prosecutors tend to be more experienced and more thorough than misdemeanor court prosecutors. They also have fewer cases so they can devote more time to each case.

If the judge’s finding supports the charge, the penalty is a 6-month license suspension, a $125 civil penalty, and a $100 suspension termination fee.\r\n\r\nEach additional offense will result in your license being revoked for at least one year or until age 21, whichever is longer, plus a $125 civil penalty, and a $100 license re-application fee.\r\n\r\nA driver under 21 years old who refuses to take a chemical test under the Zero Tolerance Law is subject to a 1-year license revocation and a $125 civil penalty.\r\n\r\nUnder 21 arrests for drinking and driving in New York carry a heavy burden that negatively impact a young person for decades.\r\n\r\nIf you, or loved one under the age of 21 have been charged with DWI/DUI or DWAI anywhere in New York, we urge you to call for a no obligation consultation.
