I bonded out and was supposed to go to court on the 23, for my Denton case, but I got the date mixed up and thought it was on the 28.  My Cameron County lawyers are taking care of my case down there, for which I had my last court appointment today,  and one of them asked a colleague from the Denton area to submit the papers to have my bond reinstated in Denton, but it was denied.  Since my Lawyers aren\\\'t familiar with the Denton courts, I was advised to consult with a local attorney on what they thought would be my best course of actions and for consultation.  I was told the bond is set for 2 cash bonds totaling $22,000.  This is for a misdemeanor 2nd offense and there are two case numbers, Case No. CR-2013-06307-B and Case No. CR-2013-06474-B.  One is for failure to appear to the Arraignment Hearing, and the other is for a no show to the Bond Condition Hearing.  I had gone to see a probation officer back in May, around the time I got arrested for my second offense, who gave me the information needed to get the Interlock device installed in my car, which I did within the time-frame I was given, and have kept up with all of the recalibration services requested since.\r\nWould you be able to help me with this?  Would it be possible to get the bonds reduced?  The fines are at a 3rd offense level, yet, this is my 2nd offense.  If not now, after 30 days?  Is it possible to get the bond reinstated and a new court date?  Should I turn myself in today or would it be okay if I waited until Monday or some other time next week?  (My lease just expired so I would have to move my stuff into a storage unit or renew my lease.  Also, I have to wait for my Mother to drive up from Brownsville, TX, which is 9 hours away, to pick up my pets and car.  She wouldn\\\'t be able to make it until later tonight since she has to work today).\r\nI graduated from UTA in July 2012 with a B.S. in Business Information Systems and I currently have a job as a Search Engine Optimizer agent.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\nDaniel Myers\r\n(956) 466-9924', '2013-11-01 16:58:40');

It’s even open source, just like WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Refined contrast</h3>\n<p>We think beautiful design should never sacrifice legibility.

Or want more information? Click to discover more. Then sit back and use your keyboard’s navigation arrows to flip through every theme you’ve got.</p>\n<h3>Smoother widget experience</h3>\n<p>Drag-drag-drag. Scroll-scroll-scroll. Widget management can be complicated. With the new design, we’ve worked to streamline the widgets screen.</p>\n<p>Have a large monitor? Multiple widget areas stack side-by-side to use the available space. Using a tablet? Just tap a widget to add it.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 class=\"aligncenter\">Twenty Fourteen, a sleek new magazine theme</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2789\" alt=\"The new Twenty Fourteen theme displayed on a laptop. tablet and phone\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twentyfourteen.jpg?resize=692%2C275\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3>Turn your blog into a magazine</h3>\n<p>Create a beautiful magazine-style site with WordPress and Twenty Fourteen.

Try it out on different devices and browsers, see how it goes, especially the more complex pages like widgets or seldom-looked-at-places like Press This. Color schemes, which you can change on your profile, have also been spruced up.</li>\n<li>The dashboard homepage has been refreshed, poke and prod it.</li>\n<li>Choosing themes under Appearance is completely different, try to break it however possible.</li>\n<li>There&#8217;s a new default theme, Twenty Fourteen.</li>\n<li>Over 250 issues closed already.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given how many things in the admin have changed it&#8217;s extra super duper important to test as many plugins and themes with admin pages against the new stuff.

This release features some of the most important architectural updates we&#8217;ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your site&#8217;s first line of defense. It&#8217;s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements. As always, if you&#8217;re hungry for more <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.7\">dive into the Codex</a> or browse the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;group=resolution&amp;milestone=3.7\">over 400 closed tickets on Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>A New Wave</h3>\n<p>This release was led by Andrew Nacin, backed up by Dion Hulse and Jon Cave. This is our first release using the new plugin-first development process, with a much shorter timeframe than in the past. (3.6 was released in August.) The 3.8 release, due in December, will continue this plugin-led development cycle that gives much more autonomy to plugin leads and allows us to decouple feature development from a release. You can follow this grand experiment, and what we&#8217;re learning from it, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">on the make/core blog</a>.

The site uses <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT</a> to monitor the changesets from the wordpress.org trac system and re-publishes the commit messages with &#8220;props&#8221; to recognize the folks who worked on the code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/props.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18345]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/props.jpg\" alt=\"props\" width=\"492\" height=\"146\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18543\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k_payne\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Payne</a> created the site with a desire to illustrate how WordPress is built through the combined efforts of many people. &#8220;PropsPress was a fun pet project I started a long time ago when I first got involved in WordPress contributions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought it would be fun to have a central place to have a call-out whenever a piece of code was contributed.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Why PropsPress?</h3>\n<p>When Payne first set up PropsPress, he wanted to highlight contributions in order to inspire more people to get involved in core contributions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I first started contributing (July 2011 or so), the core group felt pretty small and it was difficult to get people contributing.  I perceived a problem of too much work (too many trac tickets, too many things needed testing), and too little knowledge (too few core members had the right knowledge of how to use trac / WordPress).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Since that time, however, WordPress has added <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/12/31/commit-announcements-for-3-9/\" target=\"_blank\">several new committers</a> and has made great strides in making contribution more accessible vai the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/\" target=\"_blank\">Core Contributors Handbook</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Overall, WordPress is a much friendlier place for contributors,&#8221;</strong> Payne said, which he attributed to the recent <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-trac-gets-a-design-refresh-new-features-and-enhancements\" target=\"_blank\">trac re-organization and refresh</a>, as well as the addition of new group leads to help facilitate communication and representation.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PropsPress has been quietly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/propspress\" target=\"_blank\">tweeting</a> out props and publishing commit messages. &#8220;I was hoping to augment what WordPress was already doing with &#8216;recent rockstars&#8217; but on a more regular basis,&#8221; Payne said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know where it would go, so I kinda let it bake.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>A New Direction for PropsPress</h3>\n<p>Payne is unsure as to whether PropsPress actually moved the needle to inspire more contributions to WordPress but he&#8217;s looking to use the website as a way to give back to the community. He&#8217;s got a few ideas to add stats tracking for all forms of WordPress contribution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Codex contributions, support in irc / forums, ticket contributions (gardening, testing), translations, monetary donations, etc. This is all in addition to the code contributions.  I think these would be fantastic to track.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, Payne would like to be able to show a range of individual stats, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of submitted patches</li>\n<li>Number of accepted contributions</li>\n<li>Number of ticket touches</li>\n<li>Pie chart of JS / PHP / HTML</li>\n<li>Pie chart of unit tests vs. core code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payne says the idea is more for recognition and encouragement than for competition. He has reservations about adding too much gamification. &#8220;<span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">It can be dangerous to gamify it too much because then it can become less about the altruism and more about the game.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He hopes to backfill PropsPress to put each post in a tag for the users who are props&#8217;d so that the props would be queryable using WordPress taxonomies. Another interesting addition that he&#8217;d like to bring is a per-release total of &#8220;core committer code&#8221; vs &#8220;props code&#8221; in a stacked graph. &#8220;The hope is that the props code, in aggregate, is trending up!&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>One fun idea he has is to see WordPress identify &#8220;commit-anniversaries&#8221; and celebrate them, too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This is easy to automate and is already celebrated on Twitter manually. Imagine if you woke up to &#8217;1 year ago, your code was pulled into WordPress 3.6. Thank you!&#8217; with a link to the ticket. That&#8217;s something you can retweet and that&#8217;s something that people can get excited about.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some of these ideas have been included in past WordPress <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/28/contributor-stats/\" target=\"_blank\">community discussions</a> on WordPress stats, though it may not be possible to easily access this information at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Payne said that he would love to work on this project again but he needs help. &#8220;As you can tell, I have big vision and little time. Some suggestions from the leaders in the community would help set the direction.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Value of Knowing Where Contributions Come From</h3>\n<p>Payne believes that changes to PropsPress can help provide more information on where WordPress contributions come from, with the ultimate goal of improving the contribution experience. He poses a few examples:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What if WP knew that 90% of its code came from 10 people, and the other 10% came from 100 people &#8230; that&#8217;s good to know.  Or what if I told you that 80% of contributors were one-time contributors only?  That&#8217;s a totally made up number, but that type of metric is actionable. You can go find those one time contributors and do deep dives into their contribution experiences to find out why they aren&#8217;t contributing again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Payne is open to ideas and suggestions from the community to improve <a href=\"http://propspress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PropsPress</a>. What do you think about the concept of the site? Does it serve a valuable purpose?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 23:50:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: Visualize WordPress Project Stats With Ohloh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18560\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:152:\"http://wptavern.com/visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6489:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-stats.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-stats\" width=\"796\" height=\"369\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18589\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohloh</a> is an excellent resource for tracking open source projects and their contributions. The site allows you to search 10 billion lines of code and provides some fascinating data sets for OS projects, including <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> and many of its popular plugins.</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s analysis of &#8220;WordPress in a Nutshell&#8221; is based on the stats it was able to mine from the code and some in-house estimates. It provides an interesting perspective on the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress has had <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary\" target=\"_blank\">25,085 commits</a> made by <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary\" target=\"_blank\">52 contributors</a> representing <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary\" target=\"_blank\">248,090 lines of code</a></li>\n<li>WordPress is mostly written in PHP with an average number of source code comments (as compared to other PHP projects in Ohloh)</li>\n<li>WordPress has a well established, mature codebase, maintained by a large development team with <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/factoids#FactoidActivityStable\" target=\"_blank\">stable Y-O-Y commits</a></li>\n<li>WordPress took an estimated <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost\" target=\"_blank\">64 years of effort</a> (COCOMO model) starting with its <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits?sort=oldest\" target=\"_blank\">first commit</a> in April, 2003, ending with its most recent commit about 4 hours ago</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the historical data provided about commits to the project, the assessment of the trends in recent activity is quite valuable to those working within the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<h3>Communicating &#8220;Free, Yet Priceless&#8221; Is Not Easy</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve built a business around providing WordPress development services, the insight provided here can help you articulate your confidence in the stability of the project for clients who are new to OS software. The notion of using software that is free to download may be off-putting to business owners who are used to judging value by dollars and time invested.</p>\n<p>Ohlo&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/estimated_cost\" target=\"_blank\">estimated cost</a> of WordPress is $3,488,557 with 63 person-years of effort, using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO\" target=\"_blank\">Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO)</a>. While software cost estimation isn&#8217;t an exact science, especially for distributed open-source projects, a basic understanding of the COCOMO calculations provides an interesting perspective on WordPress&#8217; value. It also reveals the power of like-minded contributors working together toward a common goal.</p>\n<p>When you take into account the combined personnel attributes required to engineer and maintain a project of this size, there are few corporate entities that would have the budget to produce a project like WordPress in-house for their own development needs. That&#8217;s the beauty of open source software. Developers are happy to contribute to projects they believe in, and you can bank on people believing in the philosophy behind WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Visualize WordPress Lines of Code By Language</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary\" target=\"_blank\">languages summary</a> of the code base is of particular interest during a time when the WordPress community has been enthusiastically embracing <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-think-tank-panel-will-discuss-the-future-of-wordpress-on-feb-25th\" target=\"_blank\">dialogues</a> about its future. Ohloh offers a visual representation of WordPress lines of code by language:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18577\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wordpress-code-by-language.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress lines of code by Language\" width=\"954\" height=\"688\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18577\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress lines of code by Language</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that CSS and Javascript seem to parallel each other in terms of moderate growth over the years. PHP is still the fastest growing language in the code base, although WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg predicts that Javascript will someday make up the better part of its code. When speaking at <a href=\"http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2013</a>, Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TacoVerdo/status/386810803640209408\" target=\"_blank\">advice</a> to attendees was: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer today, learn as much JavaScript as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ohloh&#8217;s graphs make it easy to visualize composite languages used in WordPress code and lets you toggle by year in order to further explore the data and follow the resulting trends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18560]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/commits-per-month-300x152.jpg\" alt=\"commits-per-month\" width=\"300\" height=\"152\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18587\" /></a>Even with Ohloh&#8217;s limited access to the project&#8217;s public data, it&#8217;s fascinating to see how it has been able to provide visuals for stats such as <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/commits/summary\" target=\"_blank\">commits per month</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/p/wordpress/contributors/summary\" target=\"_blank\">contributors per month</a>.</p>\n<p>It would be awesome if some day WordPress.org could display more stats related to its code and contributions, which would undoubtedly provide some more meaningful data on other aspects of the project as a whole. In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.ohloh.net/\">Ohloh</a> is an excellent resource to bookmark for an interesting perspective on what&#8217;s happening with the WordPress code base.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 22:34:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: What Is The Future Of Comments In WordPress?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:150:\"http://wptavern.com/what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8291:\"<p>I&#8217;ve had a special place in my heart for comments in WordPress ever since I started using the platform. I hold comments in high regard because they often provide more insight into the topic being discussed. Comments are a validation someone&#8217;s reading my content and I look forward to reading every one of them.</p>\n<p>WordPress comments haven&#8217;t changed much in the past few years. Brian Krogsgard over at Postat.us has <a title=\"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/\" href=\"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-comments/\">published a list of ideas he has</a> to improve the way comments function in WordPress. His ideas are solid and I agree with them, especially the idea to remove what one of his clients considered to be <em>computer code</em> from the bottom of the comment form.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18508\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentComputerCode.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18508\" alt=\"So Called Computer Code\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentComputerCode-500x131.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"131\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">So Called Computer Code</p></div>\n<p>This code should be removed as suggested by Brian but I&#8217;d extend the idea to replace the text with WYSIWYG buttons people are familiar with to style text. They&#8217;re called Quicktags and WordPress supports them out of the box via the <a title=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API\">Quicktags API</a>. Quicktags provide the same type of buttons you&#8217;d see when writing a post in the Text editor of WordPress. Bonus points to theme authors who style the tags to match the rest of the theme.</p>\n<h3>Comments Of The Third Party Kind</h3>\n<p>The first thing I do after I read an article is read the comments if they&#8217;re available. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly rare to see popular sites powered by WordPress using the native comment system. Most of the comment forms I see look like this.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18509\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18509\" alt=\"Comments by disqus\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CommentsByDisqus-500x420.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"420\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Comments by disqus</p></div>\n<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t like seeing two columns of related content underneath the current conversation. I find it confusing to figure out where a conversation ends. The bottom line is more and more sites are turning to third party comment systems because of the features they have out of the box.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Tried With IntenseDebate</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18513\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18513\" alt=\"IntenseDebate Comment Form\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IntenseDebateCommentForm-500x343.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">IntenseDebate Comment Form</p></div>\n<p><a title=\"http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/\" href=\"http://blog.intensedebate.com/2008/09/23/automattic-acquires-intensedebate/\">Acquired in September of 2008</a> by Automattic, <a title=\"http://www.intensedebate.com/\" href=\"http://www.intensedebate.com/\">IntenseDebate</a> was one of many commenting services launched that year including <a href=\"http://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a>, <a href=\"http://sezwho.com/\">SezWho</a>, and <a href=\"http://js-kit.com/\">JS-Kit</a>. IntenseDebate had some cool features for comments at the time such as threaded comments and reply by email. Fast forward six years later and IntenseDebate is now on hiatus. This was confirmed by Matt Mullenweg when we interviewed him on <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-130-catching-up-with-matt-mullenweg\">episode 130 of WordPress Weekly</a>.</p>\n<p>When I asked him about the status of IntenseDebate, he replied &#8220;<em>IntenseDebate is currently on hold. It&#8217;s not actively being worked on inside Automattic. But there has been a lot of work on the Jetpack comment features such as subscriptions and interactions with social networks.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also mentioned WordPress hasn&#8217;t done a lot of things to improve areas that are user facing such as comments. The last major improvement to comments was the addition of threaded comments in <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2008/12/coltrane/\">WordPress 2.7 &#8216;Coltrane&#8217;</a>. He explained, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s very difficult to iterate comments as it&#8217;s hard to get those changes to be compatible with every WordPress theme in the world.</em>&#8221; He mentioned the possible use of API&#8217;s and ended his answer with &#8220;<em>the most interesting things happening with comments are services and Automattic&#8217;s work with Jetpack Comments.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Jetpack Powered Comments</h3>\n<p>I think it’s quite telling that WordPress.com doesn’t use IntenseDebate. Instead, it uses a custom comment system that supports using credentials from four major social media services. <strong>WordPress.com, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+</strong>. If you use Jetpack, you can use the same comment system by activating the <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/comments/\">Jetpack Comments</a> module.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18512\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18466]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18512\" alt=\"Jetpack Comment Form\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/JetpackCommentForm-500x289.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jetpack Comment Form</p></div>\n<p>The biggest problem I have with Jetpack Comments is it&#8217;s not easily extendable using various comment plugins. Or, not many plugins are compatible with Jetpack Comments. At least with IntenseDebate, there is a <a title=\"http://intensedebate.com/plugins\" href=\"http://intensedebate.com/plugins\">library of plugins</a> to add features on top of what the service already offers. Since Jetpack Comments is tied to a plugin, it&#8217;s not platform agnostic like IntenseDebate.</p>\n<h3>The Future Of Comments In WordPress Is Unclear</h3>\n<p>Between Jetpack comments and IntenseDebate, it&#8217;s unclear what the future holds for the native comment system in WordPress. There have been multiple discussions around the topic of removing comments from core and putting them into a plugin but the idea hasn&#8217;t gained traction.</p>\n<p>My hope is that native WordPress comments will continue to improve to the point where using a third party is counter-productive. I want to see WordPress make it as easy as possible to contribute to conversations on the web. When Matt Mullenweg <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2008/09/intense-debate-goes-automattic/\">published the announcement</a> of acquiring IntenseDebate on his blog in 2008, he said the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I hope he still feels that way about comments and will strive to improve that area of WordPress sooner, rather than later.</p>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<p>I encourage everyone to read <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/dear-automattic-you-are-losing-the-debate\">this blog post</a> from July 2, 2013 where Erlend Sogge Heggen wrote a post on how Automattic is losing the debate. It&#8217;s a detailed article that talks about IntenseDebate, Automattic, and commenting in WordPress in general. Also worth reading is the discussion that followed in the comments.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Mar 2014 14:00:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress and bbPress Websites Are Now Open Source: Contributions Welcome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2188:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18506]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers-300x225.png\" alt=\"buddypress-wallpapers\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-16152\" /></a>The code that powers the <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress.org</a> and <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bbPress.org</a> websites is now open source. John James Jacoby, the lead developer for the projects, announced that all of the custom code used on these sites is now available in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sites/trunk/buddypress.org/public_html/wp-content\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Subversion repository</a>.</p>\n<p>If you browse the repository, you&#8217;ll notice that the trunk has a BuddyPress.org directory but no bbPress directory. In Jacoby&#8217;s <a href=\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on bbPress.org, he explained that the bbPress website is actually part of BuddyPress.org&#8217;s WordPress installation and they share some of the same code.</p>\n<p>Open sourcing the code for these sites makes it possible for the community to take a more active role in contributing to improvements. Jacoby hopes that contributors will be enthusiastic about working together to bring new design, features, and direction to the websites:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You’re now able to checkout, review, and patch the code that makes BuddyPress.org happily hum along. This is exciting for a few obvious reasons (like security, and really putting our open source philosophies where our code is) but the one I’m most excited about is it takes enhancements to the site out of our hands, and potentially puts them into yours.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His post was essentially an open invitation to the bbPress and BuddyPress communities. Now it&#8217;s possible for anyone to jump in and contribute using the same workflow that you&#8217;ve used for contributing to bbPress and BuddyPress software in the past.

Two weeks ago, Daniel Bachhuber opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27192\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> proposing that WordPress instruct users to change their passwords when sending new account emails.</p>\n<p>When a user is added to a multisite network and has activated his account, WordPress sends out an email that includes the new password:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18488]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multisite-new-user.jpg\" alt=\"multisite-new-user\" width=\"645\" height=\"441\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18491\" /></a></p>\n<p>Several text changes were proposed for the email to urge users to change their passwords after logging in.  After a brief discussion during yesterday&#8217;s core development meeting, Andrew Nacin moved the issue to the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/components/users/login-registration/\" target=\"_blank\">Login and Registration</a> component.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to skip this entirely for 3.9,&#8221; Nacin said. He highlighted the reasons why the incremental improvements in the proposed patches don&#8217;t solve the issue, given that they:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only apply to multisite (emails are sent in plain text for new user registrations in single-site too)</li>\n<li>Only apply for the fallback email template (these are editable in multisite)\n<li>Don&#8217;t do anything in the dashboard to nag the user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nacin proposed that the core team tackle the issue for WordPress 4.0 in a way that will clearly improve the user experience. He also suggested that this issue might be combined with work on another <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24633\" target=\"_blank\">enhancement</a> that would allow admins to generate and send new passwords for users.</p>\n<p>This is a much larger task than simply changing the email text. &#8220;It&#8217;ll probably require a group of contributors to storyboard out exactly how all of this should work in an ideal situation, and then we can go about coding it,&#8221; Nacin said in response to the ticket. Aaron Jorbin <a href=\"http://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2014-03-05&sort=asc#m805112\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a> putting together a &#8220;Password Process&#8221; group to &#8220;identify some more concrete changes that we can make in 4.0 (including eliminating sending passwords via email).&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the team can find some momentum, this issue will be getting attention in WordPress 4.0.

As of WordPress 3.8, theme authors have the ability to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/26352\" target=\"_blank\">customize defaults</a> when adding custom background support. For example, you can set a default for any of the following <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS background properties</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>background-color</li>\n<li>background-image</li>\n<li>background-repeat</li>\n<li>background-attachment</li>\n<li>background-position</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oftentimes users want their sites to look similar to the demo, but they may be unaware of how to adjust the background properties to achieve that. It&#8217;s nice to have some defaults in place so that the theme looks similar to the demo right out of the box, without any adjustments.</p>\n<p>Depending on the background image that you select, it can be advantageous to set its defaults to the most sensible display for that image. For example, if your default background is an image that&#8217;s meant to tile, you want it displayed like that after the user activates the theme.</p>\n<p>Adding custom background support to the customizer is done through your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> file:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate\">add_theme_support( \'custom-background\' );</pre>\n<p>From here you can further customize the background properties by adding default arguments. Usually themes add custom background support to a setup function with other customizer options. Here&#8217;s a quick example of setting a default background to no-repeat, centered position with fixed attachment.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function yourtheme_setup() {\n	add_theme_support(\n		\'custom-background\',\n		array(\n			\'default-color\' =&gt; \'2d2d2d\',\n			\'default-image\' =&gt; get_template_directory_uri() . \'/images/background.jpg\',\n			\'default-repeat\'     =&gt; \'no-repeat\',\n			\'default-position-x\' =&gt; \'center\',\n			\'default-attachment\' =&gt; \'fixed\',\n\n		)\n	);\n}\nadd_action( \'after_setup_theme\', \'yourtheme_setup\' );\n</pre>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in the customizer by default after the user installs the new theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18114]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/background-customizer.jpg\" alt=\"background-customizer\" width=\"874\" height=\"584\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18475\" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, the user can still adjust these properties through the customizer to suit their own custom background images. The defaults simply ensure that the packaged background image looks nice when the theme is activated for the first time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 21:27:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"bbPress: Open Sourcing bbPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://bbpress.org/?p=143352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/open-sourcing-bbpress-org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1054:\"<p>Pssst&#8230; want to know a secret?

This is exciting for a few obvious reasons (like security, and really putting our open source philosophies where our code is) but the one I&#8217;m most excited about is it takes enhancements to the site out of our hands, and potentially puts them into yours.</p>\n<p>Building software that powers millions of websites is one job (a heck of a fun one, too) and building and maintaining your own support site is actually quite another (like a self portrait; it&#8217;s a fun challenge.) Now, anyone can help improve not just BuddyPress, but also the site that supports it &#8212; that&#8217;s huge &#8212; and we can&#8217;t wait to see how BuddyPress.org evolves now that it&#8217;s in your hands!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 17:53:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dougal Campbell: mysql vs mysqli in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://dougal.gunters.org/?p=76608\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/06/mysql-vs-mysqli-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2812:\"<p>I recently ran across an issue that I was previously unaware of, so other developers could run into it as well. I was having problems with a plugin, which started misbehaving. The plugin had previously worked fine (it generates a sidebar widget), and I wasn&#8217;t actively working on my site, so I wasn&#8217;t really sure when it had quit working.</p>\n<p>In the course of debugging the problem, I discovered that the plugin was throwing warnings in my PHP error log regarding the <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> function. As a quick fix, I simply replaced all of those calls with WordPress&#8217; <code>esc_sql()</code> function. Voila, problem fixed.</p>\n<p>Curious, I took a peek into <code>wp-db.php</code>, and found this block of code:</p>\n<pre><code>\n/* Use ext/mysqli if it exists and:\n *  - USE_EXT_MYSQL is defined as false, or\n *  - We are a development version of WordPress, or\n *  - We are running PHP 5.5 or greater, or\n *  - ext/mysql is not loaded.\n */\nif ( function_exists( \'mysqli_connect\' ) ) {\n        if ( defined( \'USE_EXT_MYSQL\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = ! USE_EXT_MYSQL;\n        } elseif ( version_compare( phpversion(), \'5.5\', \'&gt;=\' ) || ! function_exists( \'mysql_connect\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        } elseif ( false !== strpos( $GLOBALS[\'wp_version\'], \'-\' ) ) {\n                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;\n        }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Note the bit about using a development version of WordPress. In my case, I&#8217;m running out of svn trunk, and my server has the <code>mysqli</code> extension installed, so <code>wpdb</code> chose to use it. That&#8217;s fine.</p>\n<p>But this exposes the fact that some plugins use functions like <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> &#8220;in the raw&#8221;, so to speak, which depends on using PHP&#8217;s <code>mysql</code> extension, and not <code>mysqli</code>. WordPress provides convenience functions like <code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/esc_sql\">esc_sql</a>()</code> and <code><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#Protect_Queries_Against_SQL_Injection_Attacks\">$wpdb-&gt;prepare()</a></code> to help abstract details like this away and protect developers against environmental differences between servers.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will save somebody else out there some debugging time.</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/06/mysql-vs-mysqli-wordpress/\">mysql vs mysqli in WordPress</a>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org\">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p><div class=\"yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none\">\n<img src=\"http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130\" alt=\"YARPP\" />\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 17:30:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Dougal Campbell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Official Gravatar Mobile App In The Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:146:\"http://wptavern.com/official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=official-gravatar-mobile-app-in-the-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1612:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18451]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18453\" alt=\"Gravatar Logo 2\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/GravatarLogo.png\" width=\"239\" height=\"63\" /></a>Toni Schneider, <a title=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\" href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\">who recently switched positions</a> with Matt Mullenweg inside Automattic has <a title=\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/\" href=\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/\">asked on the Gravatar blog</a>, <em>Which platform should a Gravatar app be released for first?</em>.

The customer and license is then managed through SellWP.</em>&#8221; While marketplaces can take anywhere between 20-50% of a sale, SellWP only takes <strong>1.9% + 15¢</strong> per charge in addition to the Stripe Fee.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18436\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPDashboard.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18395]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18436\" alt=\"SellWP Dashboard\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPDashboard-500x251.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"251\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SellWP Dashboard</p></div>\n<p>By outsourcing the product management side of the business, you&#8217;re counting on the fact the site will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If SellWP experiences downtime, it could result in lost sales. The site is hosted through <a title=\"http://fortrabbit.com/\" href=\"http://fortrabbit.com/\">Fortrabbit</a>, a service dedicated to providing developers great PHP hosting environments. SellWP is transparent about the fact that their uptime is dependent upon the uptime of Fortrabbit.</p>\n<h3>SellWP Takes Most Of The Worry Out Of Selling Products</h3>\n<p>Sellers don&#8217;t have to worry about being locked into the service since they can obtain CSV files containing customers, orders, licenses, products and coupons. The service also creates daily, weekly, and monthly backups hosted at an offsite location. SellWP takes care of SSL certificates by using CloudFlare&#8217;s flexible SSL certificate. This certificate is used to secure the seller&#8217;s shopping cart and membership areas. Back filling of customer data is not currently supported but will be available in an upcoming update.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18437\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPCouponManager.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18395]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18437\" alt=\"SellWP Coupon Manager\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SellWPCouponManager-500x140.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"140\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SellWP Coupon Manager</p></div>\n<p>Turner compares SellWP to VaultPress in that both are managed solutions to a problem:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want WordPress backups you can use BackupBuddy, a self managed solution, or VaultPress a managed solution. SellWP is a managed solution for selling WordPress products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Turner if he will only allow GPLv2 or compatible licensed products to be sold through the site. His response: &#8220;<em>Yes, I believe in the GPL and intend to enforce it in the system.  The terms are actually from WordPress&#8217; boiler plate terms but this will be added once I get some time.</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to see what the service looks like behind the scenes, watch the following video.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Try It Free Until April 1st</h3>\n<p>SellWP is another service in a long line of managed solutions for WordPress. I think what the service has to offer will appeal to a lot of developers, especially those who don&#8217;t already have an established system in place to sell their products. The service is free to try til <strong>April 1st, 2014</strong>. Once the beta ends, sellers will be charged the standard fees per transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>Does SellWP look like something you would use? Will existing sellers outsource this area of their business to a third party?

The challenge is to make design changes in the child theme, without breaking the purpose of the parent theme.</p>\n<p>During the process of learning more about Stargazer, I created a child theme, which has now been approved for the WordPress Themes Directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/ex-astris\" target=\"_blank\">Ex Astris</a> was designed with bloggers in mind, since blogging is what made me fall in love with WordPress in the first place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ex-astris.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18397]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ex-astris.png\" alt=\"ex-astris\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1198\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18402\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can customize the theme with your own header and background, if desired, but the example shown here does not utilize a custom header. The theme supports all of the site layouts found in the Stargazer parent theme and can also render them on a per-post basis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Column Wide</li>\n<li>1 Column Narrow</li>\n<li>2 Columns: Content / Sidebar</li>\n<li>2 Columns: Sidebar / Content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ex Astris is packaged with editor styles to help match the visual editor&#8217;s preview to the fonts and styles used within the theme. It supports all post formats and is translation-ready. By nature of being a child theme, it automatically includes all the features found in the Stargazer parent theme, ie. sticky posts, breadcrumbs, threaded comments, etc.</p>\n<p>Check out a <a href=\"http://untame.net/ex-astris/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> of Ex Astris to see it in action.</p>\n<p>Originally, the theme was called Intrepid, but when I submitted it to WordPress.org, I found that there was already a theme with that name. <strong><em>Sidenote:</em></strong> Always check <a href=\"http://themes.svn.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">themes.svn.wordpress.org</a> before selecting a theme name if you intend to submit to the directory. Given that the directory now contains 2,366 themes, a name with two words in it is less likely to be taken.</p>\n<p>This was my first time going through the WordPress Theme Review process and I found that it&#8217;s actually fairly quick and easy for child themes. I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit along the way, thanks to the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Review Team</a> and <a href=\"http://themehybrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Justin Tadlock</a>, all of whom are passionate about helping developers create themes that adhere to WordPress best practices.</p>\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/ex-astris\" target=\"_blank\">Ex Astris</a> from WordPress.org and feel free to drop me a note on <a href=\"https://github.com/pollyplummer/ex-astris\" target=\"_blank\">github</a> if you find any bugs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Mar 2014 00:12:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: Widget Customizer Officially Merged Into Core for WordPress 3.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18381\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:190:\"http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-officially-merged-into-core-for-wordpress-3-9?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=widget-customizer-officially-merged-into-core-for-wordpress-3-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2236:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/widget-actions.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18381]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/widget-actions-300x225.png\" alt=\"widget-actions\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-15709\" /></a>In early February we <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the Widget Customizer plugin had received the green light to be merged into the WordPress core for 3.9. At that time Andrew Nacin opened a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> to help precipitate any necessary improvements and guide the details of how the files should be merged.</p>\n<p>After three weeks of polishing, the Widget Customizer feature was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/27419\" target=\"_blank\">officially merged</a> into core today. Props go out to Weston Ruter and his team of dedicated developers who helped make this feature a reality.</p>\n<p>For those adventurous souls who have been testing the feature using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-customizer/\" target=\"_blank\">Widget Customizer</a> plugin, you can now remove it and start testing it within the trunk.</p>\n<h3>No Changes Required From Theme Developers</h3>\n<p>Theme developers will not need to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-proposed-for-wordpress-3-9\" target=\"_blank\">add theme support for the customizer</a> to indicate a widget&#8217;s support for live previews, as this was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27112#comment:10\" target=\"_blank\">stripped from the version</a> of the plugin that was merged. Instead, the team opted to generalize this functionality so that any feature utilizing the customizer controls can do partial preview updates. Widgets still get live previews, but the window will refresh in an unobtrustve way as you make changes. Now that the widget customizer will soon be a native part of the WordPress publishing experience, WordPress users should be sure to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9\" target=\"_blank\">read up</a> on all the capabilities it will add.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 21:45:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"Gravatar: A question for Gravatar users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=496\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2014/03/05/a-question-for-gravatar-users/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:622:\"<p>We are working on a Gravatar mobile app and would like to ask our users:</p>\n<a name=\"pd_a_7853939\"></a>\n<div class=\"PDS_Poll\" id=\"PDI_container7853939\"></div>\n<div id=\"PD_superContainer\"></div>\n<a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7853939\">Take Our Poll</a><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gravatar.wordpress.com/496/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gravatar.wordpress.com/496/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.gravatar.com&blog=1886259&post=496&subd=gravatar&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 20:25:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Toni Schneider\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: How to Set Multiple Default Categories for WordPress Posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18342\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:162:\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-set-a-default-category-for-wordpress-posts?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-to-set-a-default-category-for-wordpress-posts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3187:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/categories.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18342]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/categories.jpg\" alt=\"04.21.2011\" width=\"900\" height=\"418\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18362\" /></a></p>\n<p>The &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; category is a generic bin where WordPress posts go when you forget to assign a category. It&#8217;s rather irksome to discover that you&#8217;ve published a post as &#8220;Uncategorized,&#8221; since it doesn&#8217;t do much to connect your readers with more useful information on your blog.</p>\n<p>One easy solution to this problem is to edit the &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; category slug in the admin at <strong>Posts > Categories</strong>. This is a decent option if you haven&#8217;t yet created any content. Another option is to set the default category at <strong>Settings > Writing</strong>. But what if you want to use multiple categories?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/default-category/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Default Category</a> is a simple plugin that lets you select category defaults for new posts. It allows you to select multiple categories to assign to uncategorized posts. With your selections in place, forgetting to categorize your post isn&#8217;t such a big deal because you can default it to be placed in one of your more general categories, such as &#8220;News&#8221; and &#8220;Tutorial&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Check out a live demo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/default-category.gif\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18342]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/default-category.gif\" alt=\"default-category\" width=\"997\" height=\"297\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18350\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Multisite Compatible</h3>\n<p>This plugin was actually created for a multisite environment, though it works just fine on single WordPress installs as well. When network activated, it allows site administrators to select default categories for their own sites.</p>\n<p>The WordPress Default Category plugin was created by <a href=\"http://makea.kalawe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Kalawe</a>. When I asked him why he made the plugin, he said that it was originally part of a custom project. &#8220;This plug-in is an offshoot of a much larger custom plugin that auto-assigns categories based on the users&#8217; location in the world,&#8221; he said. Although he can&#8217;t share the original plugin due to its use of proprietary data, he thought the basic version would be useful to others using WordPress.</p>\n<p>Setting up a default category can help to enforce editorial standards for posts so that none get lost in the generic bin of uncategorized content. It can also be useful as a quick reference for content editors who aren&#8217;t regular contributors to a site.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and it works exactly as advertised. <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/default-category/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Default Category</a> is available for free from WordPress.org. This is one of those rare plugins that is potentially useful to the vast majority of WordPress websites that make use of categories.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 18:47:04

href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wiki.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18117]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wiki.jpg\" alt=\"wiki\" width=\"1024\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18333\" /></a></p>\n<p>UserPress is a new free plugin that aims to be the ultimate wiki solution for WordPress. It provides a comprehensive set of user-friendly features that will transform your site into a collaborative hub for creating wiki content.</p>\n<p>Richard Smith, the plugin&#8217;s author, created <a href=\"http://www.userpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UserPress</a> to provide functionality that he believes is often missing from existing wiki plugins. &#8220;Over the years, I have been frustrated by the lack of a proper wiki plugin for WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I decided to build one.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Front-end Editing for Wiki Content</h3>\n<p>UserPress allows wiki users to create and edit content on the frontend of the site. Wiki participation privileges are based on user capabilities and can be manually set for each wiki.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/userpress.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18117]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/userpress.jpg\" alt=\"userpress\" width=\"1420\" height=\"896\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18295\" /></a></p>\n<p>When creating new content, users will see a list of similar existing pages, which helps to prevent collaborators from overlapping on content. If a user accesses a non-existent wiki page, the plugin will prompt him to create a new page.</p>\n<p>UserPress includes multiple options for sorting and managing wiki articles, including recently added, recently edited, recently discussed and alphabetical order. The plugin also offers an array of wiki-related widgets: search, new wikis, popular wikis, recent wikis, categories and tags, a tag cloud, and a subscription button.</p>\n<h3>Wiki Version Control and Moderation</h3>\n<p>One of UserPress&#8217; more useful features is the built-in basic version control. The plugin allows users to compare changes to documents (diff) and gives the option for editors to attach a note with each revision.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/revisions.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18117]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/revisions.png\" alt=\"revisions\" width=\"1430\" height=\"1076\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18311\" /></a></p>\n<p>UserPress allows wiki participants to moderate content using a set of customizable flags. For example, one might flag an article for poor attribution, readability or spam.</p>\n<h3>Subscription for bbPress and BuddyPress</h3>\n<p>The subscription feature allows users to monitor articles to keep track of comments and updates. However, subscription is only available for users on sites where bbPress and/or BuddyPress are activated. It fits in seamlessly with the user profile menu.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/subscription-management.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18117]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/subscription-management.png\" alt=\"Subscription management\" width=\"1191\" height=\"699\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18315\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Subscription management</p></div>\n<p>Members can navigate to the subscriptions panel to find out what&#8217;s new and to manage current active subscriptions.</p>\n<h3>Default Wiki Theme</h3>\n<p>The design for the default wiki theme is based on Zurb&#8217;s <a href=\"http://foundation.zurb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Foundation Framework</a>. UserPress includes a responsive default theme (“UserTheme”) that is automatically installed and activated once the plugin has been activated. However, the plugin will work with any WordPress theme. The automatic activation of the theme upon installation of the plugin helps users to discover that there is a theme available, but it might be disturbing if the administrator is not expecting it.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a wiki plugin that works well on its own and integrates nicely with bbPress and BuddyPress, UserPress is a solid option. Its feature set is geared towards making collaboration more efficient and productive for wiki participants. Download the plugin from <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/userpress/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org</a> or grab the latest from the <a href=\"http://www.userpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UserPress homepage</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Mar 2014 04:02:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: CampusPress Launches Managed WordPress Hosting For Multisite Networks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18224\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:202:\"http://wptavern.com/campuspress-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-multisite-networks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=campuspress-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-multisite-networks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7068:\"<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/campuspress.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18224]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/campuspress.jpg\" alt=\"campuspress\" width=\"1600\" height=\"699\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-18261\" /></a></p>\n<p>Managed WordPress hosts are popping up all over the web. The platform is now so widely used that mammoth hosting providers such as <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-managed-wordpress-hosting-service\" target=\"_blank\">GoDaddy</a> and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/mediatemple-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-package\" target=\"_blank\">MediaTemple</a> have added specialized hosting packages dedicated to WordPress customers. WordPress hosting providers that cater to a specific niche are the latest trend.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://campuspress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CampusPress </a>is a newly branded managed host that specializes in WordPress multisite networks for educational organzations. It&#8217;s actually an offshoot of <a href=\"http://edublogs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Edublogs</a>, the largest educational blogging host that has been providing multisite hosting since 2005. Due to the high demand for more CMS features, the Edublogs team decided to differentiate the services with CampusPress focused on providing multisite network hosting for schools and universities.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Edublogs Director of Operations, Ronnie Burt, to discuss the reasons for launching CampusPress as a separate entity into the managed hosting market. He said that many of the existing Edublogs customers wanted to use the service for more than blogs but were hesitant due to &#8220;blogs&#8221; within the name. &#8220;Since WordPress is all grown up and used for way more than blogging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re re-branding our Edublogs Campus service and really improving the network infrastructure and features to better support all types of sites.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>How Multisite Hosting Works at CampusPress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/osu.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18224]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/osu.jpg\" alt=\"osu\" width=\"400\" height=\"279\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-18266\" /></a>In addition to providing a hosting environment optimized for multisite networks, CampusPress accounts also include many built-in features specific to white labeling and managing a multisite network for education. A few examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domain mapping</li>\n<li>Class and student management tools</li>\n<li>Content filtering and moderation</li>\n<li>Native apps for iOS and Android</li>\n<li>LDAP, Google Apps, Shibboleth and LTI authentication options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Burt if CampusPress is one giant network that manages all the multisite installations. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t technically networks within a network,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each school has their own totally separate multisite install. We use SVN to manage WordPress core and our default plugins and themes across all of the networks.&#8221; CampusPress also provides a custom SVN folder for customers to submit and manage custom themes.</p>\n<p>The multisite hosting is truly managed in that the maintenance is handled professionally behind the scenes and customers do not have any server-level access such as FTP or the database. &#8220;This is how we can guarantee reliability and security,&#8221; Burt said. &#8220;While traditional managed hosting providers may have automated scans and a blacklist of plugins, we manually review line by line each line of code of every plugin and theme added to our networks.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Challenge of Keeping Pace With WordPress</h3>\n<p>Burt says that one of the biggest challenges of hosting multisite networks is performing upgrades. &#8220;Universities and schools often also have their own change management and branding policies and regulations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They tend to not like upgrades or major changes in the middle of the school year, and they all seam to require different things when it comes to testing, timelines, and rolling out new plugins/tools.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For example, WordPress 3.8 introduced major changes to WordPress and many organizations didn&#8217;t want to have to re-educate their users in the middle of the school year. &#8220;This is especially a challenge when they get on different versions of WordPress core,&#8221; Burt explained. &#8220;It seems like as soon as we finally get everyone happily upgraded, another version will roll out and we&#8217;ll start the process all over again. We&#8217;d upgrade them all at the same time if they&#8217;d let us.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>CampusPress Expands Beyond Educational Blogs</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thereview.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18224]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/thereview-300x245.jpg\" alt=\"thereview\" width=\"300\" height=\"245\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-18269\" /></a>With the new CampusPress branding in place, Burt and his team are able to expand beyond providing educational blogs. One of the largest categories includes news/magazine sites like, such as the <a href=\"http://blogs.du.edu/magazine/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Denver Magazine</a>. The other category they serve is faculty/department websites in need of CMS capabilities, such as the <a href=\"http://polisci.uoregon.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Oregon Political Science Department</a> and <a href=\"http://mediarelations.cornell.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell&#8217;s Media Relations Office</a>.</p>\n<p>A few interesting examples of multisite networks already hosted with CampusPress include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.cornell.edu/gateshall/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill and Melinda Gates Hall</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://emergency.cornell.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell&#8217;s Emergency Site</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://udreview.com/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Delaware Student Newspaper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.sjsu.edu/wsq\" target=\"_blank\">San Jose State&#8217;s Alumni Magazine</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://physics.uoregon.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Oregon Department Sites</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://u.osu.edu/ohiostatedrumline/\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio State&#8217;s Drumline</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress use is on the rise in the education sector.  &#8220;The buzz around WordPress at the conferences we attend and the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-edu\" target=\"_blank\">WP in Education mailing list</a> suggests a growth that parallels WordPress in business and other arenas,&#8221; Burt said. With the re-branded <a href=\"http://campuspress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CampusPress</a> website launched this week, Edublogs is officially entering the managed WordPress hosting market. The company joins <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/cart66-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-for-e-commerce\" target=\"_blank\">Cart66</a> as one of the first managed WordPress hosts catering to a specific niche.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Mar 2014 22:32:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: MediaTemple Launches WordPress Managed Hosting Package\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=18219\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:172:\"http://wptavern.com/mediatemple-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-package?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mediatemple-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-package\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9192:\"<p><div id=\"attachment_18278\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MediaTempleFeaturedImage2.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18219]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MediaTempleFeaturedImage2-500x179.png\" alt=\"Media Temple Featured Image\" width=\"500\" height=\"179\" class=\"size-large wp-image-18278\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stars6/4381851322/\">Leonardo Rizzi</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div><br />\nMediaTemple <a title=\"http://mediatemple.net/blog/news/welcome-to-the-future-of-managed-wordpress-hosting/\" href=\"http://mediatemple.net/blog/news/welcome-to-the-future-of-managed-wordpress-hosting/\">has announced</a> they have a new managed WordPress hosting package available dubbed <a title=\"http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/wordpress/\" href=\"http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/wordpress/\">Premium WordPress Hosting</a>. The package has a cost of $29 per month which places it near the top of my price comparison chart. I created this chart a few months ago when GoDaddy announced their managed WordPress hosting package.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GoDaddy – <strong>$6.99</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Siteground – <strong>$9.95</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Flywheel – <strong>$15.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>DreamPress – <strong>$19.95</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Page.ly – <strong>$24.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Pressable – <strong>$25.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>Synthesis – <strong>$27.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>WP Engine – <strong>$29.00</strong> / month</li>\n<li>MediaTemple <strong>3 WordPress Installs For $29.00</strong> / month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>MediaTemple is owned by GoDaddy but <a title=\"http://mediatemple.net/blog/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition/#merging\" href=\"http://mediatemple.net/blog/2013/10/15/faqs-about-the-godaddy-acquisition/#merging\">both companies operate independently</a> of each other. While I initially thought it was a bad idea for both GoDaddy and MediaTemple to offer managed WordPress hosting since they are in a way, the same company, I&#8217;ve come to the understanding that each one serves a different customer base.</p>\n<h3>What MediaTemple Offers</h3>\n<p>As is customary with other managed hosting providers, MediaTemple offers a staging environment to work on sites before they go live. Other notable features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy-to-use site templating</li>\n<li>Automatic updates</li>\n<li>Mobile Optimized</li>\n<li>Automatic security</li>\n<li>Automatic backups</li>\n<li>Next-gen cloud infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps one of the most important features offered is email, something <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/support/email-recommendations-from-wp-engine/\" title=\"http://wpengine.com/support/email-recommendations-from-wp-engine/\">not offered by WP Engine</a>.</p>\n<h3>MediaTemple Launches Invite Only WordPress Theme Market</h3>\n<p>The market only contains one theme created by their creative directory but the company plans on adding more from talented designers in the future. I asked MediaTemple if there was any additional information they could give me regarding their theme marketplace. Their response:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As it is now, the market place is “invite only” with specific designers and organizations building custom themes for (mt) Premium WordPress Hosting customers. The theme market place is an area of this product we’re really excited about. We have very strong partnerships in the creative and development worlds, so this model is likely to change/grow with opportunities and there will definitely be one-off scenarios here. Essentially, the sky is the limit with the market place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Customers are limited to three WordPress installations per account. If you need more, you&#8217;ll need to pay $9/month for each additional site. WordPress Multisite is currently <strong>not</strong> supported.</p>\n<p>MediaTemple states they are aiming to push out WordPress updates within 48 hours of their release. Other leading WordPress managed hosting providers can sometimes take up to a week or more to test major versions of WordPress before applying the updates to their customer&#8217;s sites. However, security and or maintenance releases are usually applied the same day. The automatic updates only apply to WordPress, not plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>When asked whether customers can initiate updates for WordPress, MediaTemple responded: &#8220;<em>Only (mt) can initiate WordPress updates for sites running on Premium WordPress Hosting</em>&#8220;. As we&#8217;ve <a title=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-host-wp-engine-will-not-support-automatic-background-updates\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-host-wp-engine-will-not-support-automatic-background-updates\">mentioned on WPTavern before</a>, this has become standard procedure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NoPluginsAllowed.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18219]\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18241\" alt=\"Plugins Not Allowed\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NoPluginsAllowed-150x150.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>Speaking of plugins, they have their own <a title=\"https://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/2075/Which+plugins+are+not+allowed+with+my+Premium+WordPress+service%3F#wp\" href=\"https://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/2075/Which+plugins+are+not+allowed+with+my+Premium+WordPress+service%3F#wp\">list of plugins not allowed</a> to be used on their managed hosting infrastructure. It&#8217;s important for customers to read through the list in case you&#8217;ve purchased a commercial version of any of the plugins listed. For example, <a title=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/\" href=\"http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/\">BackupBuddy</a> is not allowed because it duplicates existing functionality provided by MediaTemple.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Are Managed WordPress Hosting Companies The Unseen Competition For WordPress.com?</h3>\n<p>While putting this post together, I thought about how many companies within the past three years have created specially crafted hosting environments to cater to customers using WordPress. Most of the WordPress managed hosting services I know of are extensions of established companies.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18234\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WPorgvsWPcom.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18219]\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-18234\" alt=\"WordPress.com Versus WordPress.org \" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WPorgvsWPcom-500x239.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"239\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordPress.com Versus WordPress.org</p></div>\n<p>I look at managed WordPress hosting as providing the luxuries of WordPress.com but also allowing customers most of the freedoms associated with self-hosting WordPress. Customers can upload plugins, change themes, edit their themes, and perform tasks that are locked down on WordPress.com or require you to pay an upgrade fee. Plus, they have a team of people ready to help at a moments notice which places them a step above most shared webhosting services.</p>\n<h3>Tough To Compete Against Free</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dollarsign.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18219]\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1666\" alt=\"dollarsign\" src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/dollarsign.png\" width=\"102\" height=\"103\" /></a>I think the one aspect preventing more WordPress.com users from purchasing a managed hosting account is the price. <strong>$29 per month</strong>, is <strong>$348 per year</strong>. That&#8217;s a lot of money for someone to spend if they just want to publish their thoughts to the web. If you want most of the freedoms self-hosting WordPress provides without having to pay a large sum of money, <a title=\"http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx?ci=86979\" href=\"http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx?ci=86979\">GoDaddy is a nice option</a>.</p>\n<p>The price of free is hard to compete against which is why I think WordPress.com has nothing to worry about. They cater to customers who just need a quick and easy way to publish content online. I see managed WordPress hosting companies as the next step for users when they outgrow the constraints of WordPress.com or the total price of upgrades is more than the annual cost of a managed hosting account.</p>\n<h3>Ask MediaTemple Anything</h3>\n<p>The company is hosting a live <a title=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/114280592660820418185/events/c00ghkimi9a4gehbujli904sv6c\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/114280592660820418185/events/c00ghkimi9a4gehbujli904sv6c\">Google+ Hangout</a> on <strong>March 5th, 2014 at 9AM Pacific or Noon Eastern</strong> to answer any questions brought forth by the audience.

href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent\">for Lent</a> I try to give something up that I would otherwise find unimaginable or consider myself particularly dependent on. Last year I gave up meat, which isn&#8217;t that unusual but you have to remember I&#8217;m from Texas. <img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/s.ma.tt/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?w=604\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>This year as I surveyed my life there was one thing I kept coming back to as being completely dependent on: my smartphone(s). It&#8217;s only been a few years since the iPhone came out, but it&#8217;s inconceivable to imagine my life today without my calendar, email, Foursquare, Path, Chrome, Tripit, <a href=\"http://simplenote.com/\">Simplenote</a>, WordPress, Tweetbot, Sonos, Uber, Spotify and my iTunes library, and most importantly Google Maps. (On my second screen: SmartThings, Nest, Lociktron, Lutron, 1Password, Calm, Authy, NextDraft, Withings, Circa&#8230;) These apps and everything they represent weave into every aspect of my life, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m one of those people who looks at their phone <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Smartphones-Phones-Handsets-User-Cell,20645.html\">at least 150 times a day</a>.

(Yes, that includes SxSW.) For safety and business reasons I&#8217;m going to have a makes-phone-calls-only phone, and might hop in a friend&#8217;s Uber, but the idea is there will not be a device on me 24/7 that I&#8217;m tethered to, constantly looking at, and lost and hopeless without. You obviously can&#8217;t turn back the clock on progress, so I don&#8217;t expect this to be a permanent thing, but I&#8217;m curious what I miss the most, how it affects my ability to focus throughout the day, and how it changes my relationships with other people, especially the lack of messaging.</p>\n<p>I am in the market for a cool feature phone though, maybe a small one like Zoolander had or a slidey one like in the Matrix.

BuddyPress core developer Mathieu Viet, better known as <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/community/members/imath/\" target=\"_blank\">@imath</a>, has begun work on the <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429\" target=\"_blank\">enhancement</a> and plans to set it up on the <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress github account</a> soon.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_18147\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/media.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18119]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/media-300x270.png\" alt=\"Example user attachment page\" width=\"300\" height=\"270\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-18147\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example user attachment page</p></div>\n<p><strong>&#8220;The idea is also to build a BuddyPress attachment API so that plugins can use it for their components,&#8221;</strong> Viet said during a recent BuddyPress development <a href=\"https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=buddypress-dev&day=2014-02-26&sort=asc\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a>. Further down the road, the media component may be used to manage all attachments for other components, i.e. avatars for profiles and groups, files for messages, albums for members, etc. In this case attachments would refer to uploads that have BP metadata attached.</p>\n<p>Both John James Jacoby and Boone Gorges agreed that @imath&#8217;s implementation ideas for the component are quite promising and worth moving forward. &#8220;The basic idea is awesome and could be pretty transformative for BuddyPress,&#8221; Gorges commented.</p>\n<p>Gorges suggested that this feature would be an ideal candidate for developing a core component as a plugin for the purpose of increasing collaboration. &#8220;Then we could get it in people&#8217;s hands, get them testing in different environments, and we could iterate quickly,&#8221; Gorges said. &#8220;If it looks like it&#8217;ll be a fairly long dev period, we can even do like MP6 and release it as a wordpress.org plugin to get lots of testers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress core has greatly benefited from using the <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">features-as-plugins</a> development model, which helped four major features land in the 3.8 release. We&#8217;ll be tracking BuddyPress feature plugins as they emerge throughout 2014. The development survey indicated that 65 respondents from 31 countries are eager to contribute to BuddyPress in some way. Hopefully, the core team will be able to successfully use the features-as-plugins model to make it easier for new testers and contributors to get involved.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Mar 2014 20:36:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Matt: Philosophical Conversation with Reid Hoffman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=43505\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"http://ma.tt/2014/03/convo-with-reid/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:399:\"<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>The chat I had the other week with Reid Hoffman is now online.

Thank you all.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"52 country flags of survey respondents\" src=\"http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/countries.gif\" /></p>\n<h3>Goal of Survey</h3>\n<p>Guide the direction of BuddyPress plugin development in 2014</p>\n<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>\n<p>1. Discover current and actual BuddyPress usage.<br />\n2. Provide users the opportunity to post their feature requests.<br />\n3. Identify key areas for improvement.<br />\n4. Prioritize areas of BuddyPress development.<br />\n5. Set benchmarks to streamline development processes.<br />\n6. Identify volunteers who are interested in contributing to BuddyPress development.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-179110\"></span></p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>The concept of an all-out BuddyPress survey began with <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/community/members/djpaul/\" rel=\"nofollow\">@djpaul</a>’s suggestion during an IRC devchat to embed a mini-survey in the plugin’s admin “What’s new” panel a week before BP 1.9 was released last December. The idea was to engage users in BP development for version 2.0. </p>\n<p>Skype discussions a couple of days later brought about the decision that while the mini-survey was feasible, it would be much better to conduct a full-blown survey. It would be similar to the <a title=\"”2013\" href=\"http://buddypress.org/2013/09/2013-buddypress-codex-survey-results/”\">2013 Codex Survey</a> but with an expanded scope to help guide BP development in 2014. After some testing and reviews, the <a href=\"http://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/\" title=\"BuddyPress 2014 Survey Launched\">survey was launched in the second week of January</a>.</p>\n<h3>Survey Method/Design</h3>\n<p>I prepared the sample survey questions based on users’ posts at the BP Forums and the tickets at BP Trac during the Christmas holidays for review of the core team. The final 32 questions were re-categorized into four sections: a) You and BuddyPress, b) Themes and Plugins, c) Components and Participation, and d) Opinions and Requests.</p>\n<p>The online survey was created using <a>Polldaddy.com</a>. A variety of survey question types were employed to gather the data required: multiple choices, check boxes, a matrix, and open‐ended comments. The last type would also provide a veritable mine of information from responses in stand-alone questions and from “Other” options in multiple choices. </p>\n<h3>Key Findings</h3>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>bbPress (2.x)</strong> is the top forums solution for BuddyPress sites<br />\n<img alt=\"bbPress is the forum solution for most BP sites\" src=\"http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/forums-bbpress.gif\" /></li>\n<li>More than 50% of BuddyPress sites are on the <strong>latest versions of WordPress and BuddyPress</strong>.</li>\n<li>Sixty-two percent of respondents have built 1 to 5 sites each and more than half of those sites are on <strong>Shared Hosting plans</strong>.</li>\n<li>Theme Compatibility introduced in BP 1.7 has <strong>expanded the available theme choices</strong> for BuddyPress sites. Per survey, themes used for BuddyPress sites are now almost evenly divided between: a) Free WP themes with or without BP support, b) Commercial WP themes with or without BP support, and c) Own custom themes using BP theme compat or custom themes overriding template parts with BP theme compat disabled.\n<p><img alt=\"BuddyPress themes\" src=\"http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/themes1.gif\" /></li>\n<li>The top features wanted in a BuddyPress theme are:<br />\n&bull; Compatibility with the latest BP version<br />\n&bull; Responsive<br />\n&bull; Light and Fresh Design\n</li>\n<li>The top 12 BP-specific plugins and plugins with BP support activated are:<br />\n<img src=\"http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/plugins-used.png\" alt=\"Activated plugins in BP sites\" width=\"300\" height=\"auto\" class=\"alignright\" /><br />\n&bull; bbPress<br />\n&bull; BuddyPress Activity Plus<br />\n&bull; rtMedia<br />\n&bull; BuddyPress Group Email Subscription<br />\n&bull; Invite Anyone<br />\n&bull; Buddypress Docs<br />\n&bull; BuddyPress Activity Privacy<br />\n&bull; Buddypress Xprofile Custom Fields Type<br />\n&bull; BP Labs<br />\n&bull; BuddyPress Custom Profile Menu<br />\n&bull; BuddyPress Pending Activations<br />\n&bull; s2member\n</li>\n<li>The majority of users are satisfied with all BuddyPress components except for Site Tracking which can only be activated for multisite installations.\n<p><img alt=\"chart of rated BuddyPress components\" src=\"http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/components.gif\" /></li>\n<li><strong>Sixty-five respondents</strong> from 31 countries submitted their email addresses to get involved with BP development.

In addition, adopting the WordPress features-as-plugin process, some new BP features will be developed as plugins first to get more people involved in the frontend and backend requirements. </p>\n<p>You can keep abreast of latest developments by subscribing to <a href=\"http://bpdevel.wordpress.com\" title=\"BuddyPress Development blog\">http://bpdevel.wordpress.com</a> and joining <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/participate-and-contribute/#irc-chats\">BP devchats at irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, please visit the mobile-friendly <a title=\"BuddyPress 2014 Survey Results page\" href=\"http://mercime.github.io/buddyPress-2014-survey-results/index.html\">BuddyPress 2014 Survey Results page</a> to see the graphs and visualizations prepared from your responses to the survey.

The firm&#8217;s first order of business after launching was to publish a <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> to expose what King perceives to be important SEO and privacy concerns for customers of managed WordPress host <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Engine</a>.</p>\n<p>Audit WP uncovered more than 1.5 million results of WP Engine subdomains indexed in Google. Through scraping, King was able to acquire <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPengine-User-Blogs.txt\" target=\"_blank\">a massive list of indexed subdomains hosted on WP Engine</a> in addition to 2,000+ customer emails, which he did not publicize.</p>\n<p>I spoke with WP Engine founder Jason Cohen and asked if they consider this to be a privacy concern for their customers. Cohen said that it doesn&#8217;t constitute a privacy issue, given that the indexed domains are already public. &#8220;Those emails were literally already published on the Internet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is, the <em>reason</em> those were available to be scraped, is that they were already public, and scrape-able, by any person or robot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The issue with WP Engine&#8217;s staging sites being indexed was corrected some time ago, however developers will sometimes create other versions of their sites on subdomains, not fully understanding that these sites are public via a Google search. In the case of sites hosted with WP Engine, they are very easy to find, given that they all end in *.wpengine.com. When not properly hidden from search engines, sites in progress are exposed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/upstatement.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18014]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/upstatement-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"upstatement\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-18036\" /></a>As demonstrated with one particular high profile example, the staging site for <a href=\"http://www.harvardlawreview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Law Review</a> was public. If you&#8217;re curious about what the next iteration might possibly look like, King posted a screenshot in his <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>. Developers of that site have since made it private, but unfortunately, in the meantime of setting up a new WordPress install, someone got in and created an explicit website, ostensibly to prove a point. I captured a screenshot before it was taken down.</p>\n<p>This illustrates the very real danger of having your subdomains public while they are still works in progress. Ultimately, hiding these sites from Google is the responsibility of the developer, but Cohen said that they will be taking some suggestions from the post, as he mentioned in his comment on the post:</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, your suggestion that it&#8217;s better to 301 that domain is still *also* very valid. Also, not all search engines are aware of this scenario, and thus one of the take-aways we have from your article is that we should auto-force robots.txt for the XYZ.wpengine.com domains just as we do for the staging domains</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The Issue of Duplicate Content</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_18086\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/duplicate.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18014]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/duplicate.jpg\" alt=\"photo credit: Sam UL - cc\" width=\"1024\" height=\"513\" class=\"size-full wp-image-18086\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/popilop/331357312/\">Sam UL</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/\">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be very technical to know that search engines regard duplicate content as a cardinal sin and will swiftly penalize you for it. Although WP Engine forces a &#8220;deny robots everything&#8221; in the robots.txt file on staging, not all search engines will respect this.</p>\n<p>However, Jason Cohen is hanging his hat on personal assurances he received from Matt Cutts regarding the practice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Google maintains a set of root domains that they know are companies that do exactly what we and many other hosting companies do. Included in that list are WordPress.com, SquareSpace, and us. When they detect &#8220;duplicate content&#8221; on subdomains from that list, they know that&#8217;s not actually duplicate content. You can see it in Google Search, but it&#8217;s not counted against you.</p>\n<p>We have had a dialog directly with Matt Cutts on this point, so this is not conjecture, but fact.</p></blockquote>\n<p>SEO is oftentimes a moving target and there are <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95kNwZw8YY\" target=\"_blank\">varying and contradictory opinions</a> about many of the fundamentals, including issues such as duplicate content.</p>\n<p>King <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/#comment-1263322248\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> that he doesn&#8217;t trust any information from Matt Cutts to be &#8220;fact.&#8221; He replied that they don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s wise to let Google determine which site is a duplicate and that&#8217;s why the post offers step-by-step instructions to help WP Engine customers set up the proper subdomain redirects to prevent indexing.</p>\n<h3>A Long Standing Issue with Subdomains</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fallacies.jpg\" rel=\"prettyphoto[18014]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fallacies-227x300.jpg\" alt=\"fallacies\" width=\"227\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-18034\" /></a>The post on Audit WP sent WP Engine into damage control mode and they launched a massive Twitter campaign of replies discrediting the main points of the article. So far they have not tweeted any acknowledgement of the suggestions that they will be implementing.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Audit WP&#8217;s founder Jacob King to find out his motivation behind publicizing his findings of the 1.5 million indexed subdomains.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, we were a bit floored upon the initial discovery,&#8221; King said. &#8220;As someone with web scraping experience, the ease of access to WP Engine user names, emails, and other information troubled me greatly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also felt that it was important to go public with the information given his previous interactions with WP Engine support:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was hosting my personal blog there so I have a good amount of experience with the system. One big issue was my actual monthly human traffic being massively different from the traffic stats WP Engine was recording. A very large difference, analytics showing ~25k monthly visits, yet WP engine was showing well over 100k. I brought it up on Facebook and one day on Twitter as well, I was told it&#8217;s from Bot traffic and search engine spiders.</p></blockquote>\n<p>When King commented that he had blocked all common bots and asked for further explanation of his  bot traffic being more than 5 times his human visitors, he received no reply.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We never discussed anything specific to the indexation issue,&#8221; King said. &#8220;I went with my gut which told me they wouldn&#8217;t give me the time of day if we didn&#8217;t make it public.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Audit WP is not the first to publicize problems with WP Engine&#8217;s subdomains. Although, WordPress SEO expert Joost de Valk <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/#comment-1263346408\" target=\"_blank\">chimed in</a> on the post to condemn King&#8217;s public handling of the situation, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoast/status/321731494542462976\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> last April regarding what he perceived to be an SEO mistake by WP Engine:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>What you get if your WP host makes SEO mistakes? Issues… <a href=\"http://t.co/P3dTNDL1NC\">http://t.co/P3dTNDL1NC</a> vs <a href=\"http://t.co/oAhwDJrMce\">http://t.co/oAhwDJrMce</a> &#8211; that’s… a pity.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Joost de Valk (@yoast) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoast/statuses/321731494542462976\">April 9, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>WP Engine co-founder Ben Metcalfe responded in a blog <a href=\"https://ben.wpengine.com/wp-engine-sub-domains-addressable-on-client-installs/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> at that time, clarifying that clients can redirect traffic arriving at the WP Engine subdomain to the primary domain via the .htaccess file or the client portal. He also clarified why this is not done by default: &#8220;We don’t do this by default because it would then prevent us accessing the site via the sub-domain during a support call/etc, should the DNS on the primary domain fail.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Joost de Valk replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If it were truly that common I wouldn’t have tweeted it. It’s an issue, it’s something you’re aware of because there’s a setting for it, but it’s something you could &#038; should prevent from happening altogether. That’s what the “managed” in managed hosting stands for in my eyes.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wpsitecare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Site Care</a> founder Ryan Sullivan, <a href=\"http://chrislema.com/give-feedback/#comment-11300\" target=\"_blank\">reiterated</a> that this issue has been a customer concern for quite some time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve brought this issue up to WP Engine on several different occasions through several different channels. In fact, it was Rob who pointed the issue out to me early last year, and I’ve never once been given a clear answer on plans to solve it. And with the number of sites we host on WP Engine (I give them a lot of money every month), this is a legitimate concern that should have been addressed a long time ago.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post on Audit WP brought attention to an issue that was originally discussed in April of 2013 without a satisfactory response from WP Engine. Metcalfe&#8217;s <a href=\"https://ben.wpengine.com/wp-engine-sub-domains-addressable-on-client-installs/\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> addressing the issue concluded by stating that it&#8217;s a common practice for all web hosts that don’t use <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html\" target=\"_blank\">VirtualHosts</a>.</p>\n<h3>Forthcoming Changes at WP Engine</h3>\n<p>When I spoke with Jason Cohen, he confirmed that the post has spurred them to make some changes at WP Engine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First, we&#8217;re making a change to /robots.txt when served from our canonical domain (i.e. the ABC.wpengine.com style domains) so that spiders won&#8217;t index or crawl those domains.&#8221; Although it is WP Engine&#8217;s official position that there is no SEO penalty for what they are already doing, the company has decided that it&#8217;s a good idea to make this change anyway.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Second, the point was made that our customers ought to 301-redirect their ABC.wpengine.com domains to their proper domains,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;We agree that&#8217;s a best-practice. While that&#8217;s trivial to do in our User Portal, we do NOT do a good job TELLING customers that this is a good idea.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Engine is also considering a more push-button approach to suggest that developers make their staging sites private via a plugin of some kind. They are in the process of creating a &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; document which they will include in their public knowledgebase. &#8220;We are going to proactively link to it inside our User Portal for all customers to see,&#8221; Cohen said.  The article will include suggestions with screenshots so that customers will be better-informed.</p>\n<p>Cohen said that if they make any sweeping product changes, they will email customers. However, they do not have plans to proactively email the owners of the 1.5 million subdomains that have been indexed by Google, given that some of those are intentionally public.</p>\n<p>If your site is among <a href=\"http://auditwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/WPengine-User-Blogs.txt\" target=\"_blank\">the list</a> found by Audit WP and your subdomain isn&#8217;t meant to be public, you may want to double check your robots.txt file and set up the proper 301 redirects. Ultimately, no matter how many conveniences a managed host provides its customers, the responsibility for any subdomains falls to the site owner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Mar 2014 00:37:01

Additional and/or monthly fees are also applicable, depending on the store provider selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ecommerce.png\" rel=\"prettyphoto[17767]\"><img src=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ecommerce.png\" alt=\"ecommerce\" width=\"2424\" height=\"826\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17959\" /></a></p>\n<h3>WordPress.com E-Commerce Excludes Native WordPress Solutions</h3>\n<p>Notably absent from its partners are any native WordPress e-commerce plugins. This isn&#8217;t surprising, given that Automattic has historically favored <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service\" target=\"_blank\">SaaS</a> solutions when it comes to WordPress products.</p>\n<p>The new offering was not without criticism from those who had hoped to see a few of WordPress&#8217; high quality e-commerce plugins thrown into the mix. Commenting on the <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/wordpress-business-ecommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement post</a>, WordPress developer Brent Shepherd <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/wordpress-business-ecommerce/#comment-196231\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It’s incredibly exciting to see WordPress.com offer eCommerce, but a real shame to see the many excellent open-source options snubbed (including those built specifically for WordPress).</p>\n<p>I understand the many very good reasons why it makes sense to partner with existing hosted services, but I hope that one day, we’ll see WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) and other open-source eCommerce options alongside these initial launch partners.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is a point of contention for those who would like to see more fluidity for users transitioning between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress installations. A native WordPress e-commerce option might make it easier to transition stores that have outgrown the hosted solution.</p>\n<p>Whereas some have perceived the decision to partner with outside e-commerce providers as an outright snubbing of WordPress&#8217; home grown solutions, the reality is that most WordPress.com users probably don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s under the hood to power their stores. If they did, they would likely be more inclined to go the self-hosted route.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was created to help make the process of setting up and hosting a WordPress blog virtually painless for those who don&#8217;t want to dive into the technical details of setup and maintenance. The e-commerce partners they have selected have a similar audience of sellers who do not wish to be bothered with the technical burden of hosting their own e-commerce installations.</p>\n<h3>The Rising Demand for Hosted E-Commerce</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s $299/year price point is actually quite tempting for those who simply want to marry a hosted WordPress blog to a hosted store under one domain. This product attracts those who prefer to offload the burden of PCI compliance, SSL certificates, payment gateway maintenance and everything else required for selling online.</p>\n<p>Granular control of individual product display is limited to shortcode attributes within the WordPress.com stores, but customers are more than happy to trade deeper level customization for convenience. Aside from slapping a &#8220;Pay Now&#8221; Paypal button on a website, most modern e-commerce implementations require a tech-savvy administrator who isn&#8217;t afraid to tackle a few challenges. A hosted storefront is a more approachable option than the prospect of having to learn everything involved. It&#8217;s also more affordable than hiring a developer.</p>\n<p>Last year we featured <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/cart66-launches-wordpress-managed-hosting-for-e-commerce\" target=\"_blank\">Cart66&#8242;s launch</a> as a fully managed WordPress e-commerce platform. With Automattic getting into the game, you know there&#8217;s a clear demand for this. People are looking to seamlessly couple the power of WordPress publishing with an online storefront and they&#8217;re willing to pay for convenience. As more retailers turn to the internet to expand their sales to a global audience, the demand for hosted e-commerce solutions will continue to rise. Any company that can provide a painless experience for customers will take a huge slice of this market.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 00:58:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 05:52:09 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"179521\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 05:30:12 GMT\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20140228122052\";}', 'no');

The site uses IFTTT to monitor the changesets from the wordpress.org trac system and re-publishes the commit messages with “props” to recognize the folks who worked on the code.  WordPress developer Kurt Payne created the site with a desire to illustrate how WordPress is built through the combined efforts of many people. “PropsPress was a fun pet project I started a long time ago when I first got involved in WordPress contributions,” he said. “I thought it would be fun to have a central place to have a call-out whenever a piece of code was contributed.” Why PropsPress? When Payne first set up PropsPress, he wanted to highlight contributions in order to inspire more people to get involved in core contributions: When I first started contributing (July 2011 or so), the core group felt pretty small and it was difficult to get people contributing.  I perceived a problem of too much work (too many trac tickets, too many things needed testing), and too little knowledge (too few core members had the right knowledge of how to use trac / WordPress). Since that time, however, WordPress has added several new committers and has made great strides in making contribution more accessible vai the Core Contributors Handbook. “Overall, WordPress is a much friendlier place for contributors,” Payne said, which he attributed to the recent trac re-organization and refresh, as well as the addition of new group leads to help facilitate communication and representation. Meanwhile, PropsPress has been quietly tweeting out props and publishing commit messages. “I was hoping to augment what WordPress was already doing with ‘recent rockstars’ but on a more regular basis,” Payne said. “I didn’t know where it would go, so I kinda let it bake.” A New Direction for PropsPress Payne is unsure as to whether PropsPress actually moved the needle to inspire more contributions to WordPress but he’s looking to use the website as a way to give back to the community. He’s got a few ideas to add stats tracking for all forms of WordPress contribution: Codex contributions, support in irc / forums, ticket contributions (gardening, testing), translations, monetary donations, etc. This is all in addition to the code contributions.  I think these would be fantastic to track. Ideally, Payne would like to be able to show a range of individual stats, including:  Number of submitted patches Number of accepted contributions Number of ticket touches Pie chart of JS / PHP / HTML Pie chart of unit tests vs. core code  Payne says the idea is more for recognition and encouragement than for competition. He has reservations about adding too much gamification. “It can be dangerous to gamify it too much because then it can become less about the altruism and more about the game.” He hopes to backfill PropsPress to put each post in a tag for the users who are props’d so that the props would be queryable using WordPress taxonomies. Another interesting addition that he’d like to bring is a per-release total of “core committer code” vs “props code” in a stacked graph. “The hope is that the props code, in aggregate, is trending up!” he said. One fun idea he has is to see WordPress identify “commit-anniversaries” and celebrate them, too. This is easy to automate and is already celebrated on Twitter manually. Imagine if you woke up to ’1 year ago, your code was pulled into WordPress 3.6. Thank you!’ with a link to the ticket. That’s something you can retweet and that’s something that people can get excited about. Some of these ideas have been included in past WordPress community discussions on WordPress stats, though it may not be possible to easily access this information at this point in time. Payne said that he would love to work on this project again but he needs help. “As you can tell, I have big vision and little time. Some suggestions from the leaders in the community would help set the direction.” The Value of Knowing Where Contributions Come From Payne believes that changes to PropsPress can help provide more information on where WordPress contributions come from, with the ultimate goal of improving the contribution experience. He poses a few examples: What if WP knew that 90% of its code came from 10 people, and the other 10% came from 100 people … that’s good to know.  Or what if I told you that 80% of contributors were one-time contributors only?  That’s a totally made up number, but that type of metric is actionable. You can go find those one time contributors and do deep dives into their contribution experiences to find out why they aren’t contributing again. Payne is open to ideas and suggestions from the community to improve PropsPress. What do you think about the concept of the site? Does it serve a valuable purpose?\'>WPTavern: A Look Behind PropsPress: A Site Dedicated to WordPress Contributors</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=visualize-wordpress-project-stats-with-ohloh\' title=\' Ohloh is an excellent resource for tracking open source projects and their contributions. The site allows you to search 10 billion lines of code and provides some fascinating data sets for OS projects, including WordPress and many of its popular plugins. Ohloh’s analysis of “WordPress in a Nutshell” is based on the stats it was able to mine from the code and some in-house estimates. It provides an interesting perspective on the project:  WordPress has had 25,085 commits made by 52 contributors representing 248,090 lines of code WordPress is mostly written in PHP with an average number of source code comments (as compared to other PHP projects in Ohloh) WordPress has a well established, mature codebase, maintained by a large development team with stable Y-O-Y commits WordPress took an estimated 64 years of effort (COCOMO model) starting with its first commit in April, 2003, ending with its most recent commit about 4 hours ago  In addition to the historical data provided about commits to the project, the assessment of the trends in recent activity is quite valuable to those working within the WordPress ecosystem. Communicating “Free, Yet Priceless” Is Not Easy If you’ve built a business around providing WordPress development services, the insight provided here can help you articulate your confidence in the stability of the project for clients who are new to OS software. The notion of using software that is free to download may be off-putting to business owners who are used to judging value by dollars and time invested. Ohlo’s estimated cost of WordPress is $3,488,557 with 63 person-years of effort, using the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO). While software cost estimation isn’t an exact science, especially for distributed open-source projects, a basic understanding of the COCOMO calculations provides an interesting perspective on WordPress’ value. It also reveals the power of like-minded contributors working together toward a common goal. When you take into account the combined personnel attributes required to engineer and maintain a project of this size, there are few corporate entities that would have the budget to produce a project like WordPress in-house for their own development needs. That’s the beauty of open source software. Developers are happy to contribute to projects they believe in, and you can bank on people believing in the philosophy behind WordPress. Visualize WordPress Lines of Code By Language The languages summary of the code base is of particular interest during a time when the WordPress community has been enthusiastically embracing dialogues about its future. Ohloh offers a visual representation of WordPress lines of code by language: WordPress lines of code by Language It’s interesting to note that CSS and Javascript seem to parallel each other in terms of moderate growth over the years. PHP is still the fastest growing language in the code base, although WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg predicts that Javascript will someday make up the better part of its code. When speaking at WordCamp Europe 2013, Mullenweg’s advice to attendees was: “If you’re a developer today, learn as much JavaScript as possible.” Ohloh’s graphs make it easy to visualize composite languages used in WordPress code and lets you toggle by year in order to further explore the data and follow the resulting trends. Even with Ohloh’s limited access to the project’s public data, it’s fascinating to see how it has been able to provide visuals for stats such as commits per month and contributors per month. It would be awesome if some day WordPress.org could display more stats related to its code and contributions, which would undoubtedly provide some more meaningful data on other aspects of the project as a whole. In the meantime, Ohloh is an excellent resource to bookmark for an interesting perspective on what’s happening with the WordPress code base.\'>WPTavern: Visualize WordPress Project Stats With Ohloh</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=what-is-the-future-of-comments-in-wordpress\' title=\'I’ve had a special place in my heart for comments in WordPress ever since I started using the platform. I hold comments in high regard because they often provide more insight into the topic being discussed. Comments are a validation someone’s reading my content and I look forward to reading every one of them. WordPress comments haven’t changed much in the past few years. Brian Krogsgard over at Postat.us has published a list of ideas he has to improve the way comments function in WordPress. His ideas are solid and I agree with them, especially the idea to remove what one of his clients considered to be computer code from the bottom of the comment form. So Called Computer Code This code should be removed as suggested by Brian but I’d extend the idea to replace the text with WYSIWYG buttons people are familiar with to style text. They’re called Quicktags and WordPress supports them out of the box via the Quicktags API. Quicktags provide the same type of buttons you’d see when writing a post in the Text editor of WordPress. Bonus points to theme authors who style the tags to match the rest of the theme. Comments Of The Third Party Kind The first thing I do after I read an article is read the comments if they’re available. Unfortunately, it’s becoming increasingly rare to see popular sites powered by WordPress using the native comment system. Most of the comment forms I see look like this. Comments by disqus Personally, I don’t like seeing two columns of related content underneath the current conversation. I find it confusing to figure out where a conversation ends. The bottom line is more and more sites are turning to third party comment systems because of the features they have out of the box. Automattic Tried With IntenseDebate IntenseDebate Comment Form Acquired in September of 2008 by Automattic, IntenseDebate was one of many commenting services launched that year including Disqus, SezWho, and JS-Kit. IntenseDebate had some cool features for comments at the time such as threaded comments and reply by email. Fast forward six years later and IntenseDebate is now on hiatus. This was confirmed by Matt Mullenweg when we interviewed him on episode 130 of WordPress Weekly. When I asked him about the status of IntenseDebate, he replied “IntenseDebate is currently on hold. It’s not actively being worked on inside Automattic. But there has been a lot of work on the Jetpack comment features such as subscriptions and interactions with social networks.” He also mentioned WordPress hasn’t done a lot of things to improve areas that are user facing such as comments. The last major improvement to comments was the addition of threaded comments in WordPress 2.7 ‘Coltrane’. He explained, “It’s very difficult to iterate comments as it’s hard to get those changes to be compatible with every WordPress theme in the world.” He mentioned the possible use of API’s and ended his answer with “the most interesting things happening with comments are services and Automattic’s work with Jetpack Comments.” Jetpack Powered Comments I think it’s quite telling that WordPress.com doesn’t use IntenseDebate. Instead, it uses a custom comment system that supports using credentials from four major social media services. WordPress.com, Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. If you use Jetpack, you can use the same comment system by activating the Jetpack Comments module. Jetpack Comment Form The biggest problem I have with Jetpack Comments is it’s not easily extendable using various comment plugins. Or, not many plugins are compatible with Jetpack Comments. At least with IntenseDebate, there is a library of plugins to add features on top of what the service already offers. Since Jetpack Comments is tied to a plugin, it’s not platform agnostic like IntenseDebate. The Future Of Comments In WordPress Is Unclear Between Jetpack comments and IntenseDebate, it’s unclear what the future holds for the native comment system in WordPress. There have been multiple discussions around the topic of removing comments from core and putting them into a plugin but the idea hasn’t gained traction. My hope is that native WordPress comments will continue to improve to the point where using a third party is counter-productive. I want to see WordPress make it as easy as possible to contribute to conversations on the web. When Matt Mullenweg published the announcement of acquiring IntenseDebate on his blog in 2008, he said the following: Long-term, I think that comments are the most crucial interaction point for blogs, and an area that deserves a lot of investment and innovation. I hope he still feels that way about comments and will strive to improve that area of WordPress sooner, rather than later. Further Reading I encourage everyone to read this blog post from July 2, 2013 where Erlend Sogge Heggen wrote a post on how Automattic is losing the debate. It’s a detailed article that talks about IntenseDebate, Automattic, and commenting in WordPress in general. Also worth reading is the discussion that followed in the comments.\'>WPTavern: What Is The Future Of Comments In WordPress?</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://wptavern.com/buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=buddypress-and-bbpress-websites-are-now-open-source-contributions-welcome\' title=\'The code that powers the BuddyPress.org and bbPress.org websites is now open source. John James Jacoby, the lead developer for the projects, announced that all of the custom code used on these sites is now available in the Meta Subversion repository. If you browse the repository, you’ll notice that the trunk has a BuddyPress.org directory but no bbPress directory. In Jacoby’s announcement on bbPress.org, he explained that the bbPress website is actually part of BuddyPress.org’s WordPress installation and they share some of the same code. Open sourcing the code for these sites makes it possible for the community to take a more active role in contributing to improvements. Jacoby hopes that contributors will be enthusiastic about working together to bring new design, features, and direction to the websites: You’re now able to checkout, review, and patch the code that makes BuddyPress.org happily hum along. This is exciting for a few obvious reasons (like security, and really putting our open source philosophies where our code is) but the one I’m most excited about is it takes enhancements to the site out of our hands, and potentially puts them into yours. His post was essentially an open invitation to the bbPress and BuddyPress communities. Now it’s possible for anyone to jump in and contribute using the same workflow that you’ve used for contributing to bbPress and BuddyPress software in the past. What would you like to change or add to the project sites?\'>WPTavern: BuddyPress and bbPress Websites Are Now Open Source: Contributions Welcome</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://ma.tt/2014/03/sxsw-anti-parties/\' title=\'I have a few quotes and thoughts in the WSJD article At Lavish SXSW Festival, Some Avoid Marketing Circus.\'>Matt: SXSW Anti-Parties</a></li></ul></div>', 'no');

Whether your divorce is taking place in Maryland or Washington, D.C., the best interest of the children must be paramount.\r\n\r\nChild custody is a vital component in resolving a divorce.

The rights of the father are often forgotten in child custody matters. The mother is often presumed to be the better option for primary or sole custody. Today, fathers are taking a more active role in their children\'s lives and can be as good a parent as, and sometimes better than, the mother.\r\n<h3>Differences in Child Custody Laws in Maryland and Washington, D.C.</h3>\r\nIn Maryland, a presumption of joint custody exists regardless of gender, meaning parents gets equal time with the children. However, men have to provide more proof that they can care for children during their \"tender years.\" That includes providing an adequate residence, working a job schedule conducive to spending time with their children, and being active in all aspects of their child\'s life. Washington, D.C., has no such requirements and shared custody can be as low as 35 percent of the time.\r\n<h3>Focusing on the Best Interests of the Children</h3>\r\nChild custody battles sometimes erupt due to money issues. The more custody responsibility a spouse has, the less paid in child support. At our firm, we believe that parenting time is too vital to modify it over money.\r\n\r\nOur office is within walking distance from the metro. You may take the Green Line to Prince George’s Plaza.

Whether your divorce is taking place in Maryland or Washington, D.C., the best interest of the children must be paramount.\r\n\r\nChild custody is a vital component in resolving a divorce. We strive to utilize the mediation process to find a satisfactory arrangement<img class=\"alignright  wp-image-824\" alt=\"i-prac-childcustody\" src=\"http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/i-prac-childcustody.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"253\" /> for both sides, with the best interests of the children in mind.\r\n<h3>Defending Both Fathers\' and Mothers\' Rights in Child Custody Cases</h3>\r\nAt Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, we defend and protect the rights of our clients involved in child custody disputes. The rights of the father are often forgotten in child custody matters. The mother is often presumed to be the better option for primary or sole custody. Today, fathers are taking a more active role in their children\'s lives and can be as good a parent as, and sometimes better than, the mother.\r\n<h3>Differences in Child Custody Laws in Maryland and Washington, D.C.</h3>\r\nIn Maryland, a presumption of joint custody exists regardless of gender, meaning parents gets equal time with the children. However, men have to provide more proof that they can care for children during their \"tender years.\" That includes providing an adequate residence, working a job schedule conducive to spending time with their children, and being active in all aspects of their child\'s life. Washington, D.C., has no such requirements and shared custody can be as low as 35 percent of the time.\r\n<h3>Focusing on the Best Interests of the Children</h3>\r\nChild custody battles sometimes erupt due to money issues. The more custody responsibility a spouse has, the less paid in child support. At our firm, we believe that parenting time is too vital to modify it over money.\r\n\r\nOur office is within walking distance from the metro. You may take the Green Line to Prince George’s Plaza. We are near Prince George’s Plaza Mall in the new development of University Town Center.

Even worse is a case in which the injury could have been prevented. For these reasons, laws exist in Maryland that give victims and their families the right to pursue medical malpractice cases. Not only can this alleviate some of their burden from medical expenses and ongoing treatment and care, but it can give hospital and medical practitioners extra incentive to be sure their procedures are carried out with accuracy and safety, to prevent doctor errors.\r\n\r\nA family was recently awarded $5.25 million in a medical negligence claim against Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The Ohio Court of Claims determined the hospital was responsible for the couple\'s son being born with brain damage that resulted in permanent disability in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe baby boy was delivered by an emergency C-section, but the court found that the doctor didn’t properly manage the mother’s labor. He allegedly took too long to realize the C-section was needed, and the baby suffered from blood and oxygen loss. Additionally, two other doctors affirmed that the obstetrician didn’t properly manage the use of Pitocin during the woman’s labor, further resulting in the baby’s permanent brain injury.\r\n\r\nThe boy, now seven years old, requires constant care, which of course has resulted in mounting medical bills.

Even worse is a case in which the injury could have been prevented. For these reasons, laws exist in Maryland that give victims and their families the right to pursue medical malpractice cases. Not only can this alleviate some of their burden from medical expenses and ongoing treatment and care, but it can give hospital and medical practitioners extra incentive to be sure their procedures are carried out with accuracy and safety, to prevent doctor errors.\r\n\r\nA family was recently awarded $5.25 million in a medical negligence claim against Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The Ohio Court of Claims determined the hospital was responsible for the couple\'s son being born with brain damage that resulted in permanent disability in 2006.\r\n\r\nThe baby boy was delivered by an emergency C-section, but the court found that the doctor didn’t properly manage the mother’s labor. He allegedly took too long to realize the C-section was needed, and the baby suffered from blood and oxygen loss. Additionally, two other doctors affirmed that the obstetrician didn’t properly manage the use of Pitocin during the woman’s labor, further resulting in the baby’s permanent brain injury.\r\n\r\nThe boy, now seven years old, requires constant care, which of course has resulted in mounting medical bills. The parents have stated their satisfaction with the settlement, which should help with the compensation of his care and medical expenses. It can also be hoped that more care will be taken with future labors and deliveries to prevent the same type of tragic birth injury from happening to any other babies.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>The Columbus Dispatch, “<a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2013/06/27/malpractice-claim-settled.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury during birth costs Ohio State hospital $5.25 million</a>,” Ben Sutherly, June 28, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Ohio hospital found responsible for birth injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '846-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '2014-02-28 07:16:40', '', '846', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/846-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

It\'s great to stay in shape and enjoy the outdoors, but Maryland residents should understand that most physical activity comes with certain risks. Some types of sports are especially prone to cause head injuries. By no means should this be a reason to stay inside and avoid physical exercise, but when people understand the risks and take reasonable precautions, the danger is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nSince March is Brain Injury Awareness Month, medical experts have put together a list of warning symptoms that may signal a serious head injury. Being aware of these signs is one of the ways people of all ages can stay safe while enjoying their favorite sports or activities. If you or someone else has fallen or received a strike to the head, a visit to the doctor is highly advised if any of the following signs are noticed:\r\n\r\n• Tired, slow-moving, clumsy, dazed or confused\r\n\r\n• Slow or uncharacteristic speech, a difference in behavior\r\n\r\n• Dizziness or double or blurry vision\r\n\r\n• Loss of consciousness, even briefly\r\n\r\n• Nausea or headache, feeling generally sick\r\n\r\n• Bright lights or noise cause pain or discomfort\r\n\r\nChildren are especially vulnerable to brain trauma, so it\'s important that parents and coaches fully understand the above signs and engage in safe play precautions, such as helmets with football practice. If a serious head injury does occur, those who are injured should not return to their normal sports or activities until a doctor says it\'s safe; otherwise, long-term brain damage may result.\r\n\r\nDespite safety precautions and awareness, accidents will still happen. If someone else\'s negligence is the cause of a head injury, the victims are entitled to seek compensation for their medical expenses and other problems resulting from the accident.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: York News Times, \"<a href=\"http://www.yorknewstimes.com/news/brain-injury-awareness-month/article_5034d4b8-9376-11e2-99ff-0019bb2963f4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury awareness month</a>,\" Mar. 23, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Be aware of the signs of brain injury', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'be-aware-of-the-signs-of-brain-injury', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '', '0', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/?p=886', '0', 'post', '', '0');

By no means should this be a reason to stay inside and avoid physical exercise, but when people understand the risks and take reasonable precautions, the danger is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nSince March is Brain Injury Awareness Month, medical experts have put together a list of warning symptoms that may signal a serious head injury. Being aware of these signs is one of the ways people of all ages can stay safe while enjoying their favorite sports or activities. If you or someone else has fallen or received a strike to the head, a visit to the doctor is highly advised if any of the following signs are noticed:\r\n\r\n• Tired, slow-moving, clumsy, dazed or confused\r\n\r\n• Slow or uncharacteristic speech, a difference in behavior\r\n\r\n• Dizziness or double or blurry vision\r\n\r\n• Loss of consciousness, even briefly\r\n\r\n• Nausea or headache, feeling generally sick\r\n\r\n• Bright lights or noise cause pain or discomfort\r\n\r\nChildren are especially vulnerable to brain trauma, so it\'s important that parents and coaches fully understand the above signs and engage in safe play precautions, such as helmets with football practice. If a serious head injury does occur, those who are injured should not return to their normal sports or activities until a doctor says it\'s safe; otherwise, long-term brain damage may result.\r\n\r\nDespite safety precautions and awareness, accidents will still happen. If someone else\'s negligence is the cause of a head injury, the victims are entitled to seek compensation for their medical expenses and other problems resulting from the accident.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: York News Times, \"<a href=\"http://www.yorknewstimes.com/news/brain-injury-awareness-month/article_5034d4b8-9376-11e2-99ff-0019bb2963f4.html\" target=\"_blank\">Brain injury awareness month</a>,\" Mar. 23, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Be aware of the signs of brain injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '886-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '2014-02-28 07:33:28', '', '886', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/886-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

He says parents and coaches need to make sure to take certain precautions and provide the necessary safety equipment and training to reduce the chance of child injury.\r\n\r\nEye injuries are most commonly associated with kids playing sports, including baseball, with almost 40,000 sports-related eye injuries each year - baseball being a leading cause. Because children\'s depth perception is still developing, the pediatric specialist recommends protective lenses, especially for children who wear glasses, and a face shield for the batter\'s helmet.\r\n\r\nOther risks common to baseball include shoulder and elbow injuries with pitchers and catchers, the risk of being hit by a thrown bat, and inattention by players not currently in the game. Experts caution for coaches to teach kids to be attentive at all times, even while in the dugout.\r\n\r\nBeing seriously injured while playing a sport can cause a liability issue for the sports team or owner of the property where games are played. Many popular spring and summer sports carry the risk of head trauma, broken bones, and other injuries, but most experts agree that with the proper training and precautions, there\'s no reason not to have fun and enjoy summer sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: NewsMedical.net, \"<a href=\"http://www.news-medical.net/news/20130328/Children-are-vulnerable-to-eye-injury-while-playing-baseball-expert-says.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Children are vulnerable to eye injury while playing baseball, expert says</a>,\" Mar. 28, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Baseball is good exercise, but carries the risk of child injury', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '898-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:43:02', '2014-02-28 07:43:02', '', '898', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/898-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

They combat obesity, are healthy for the heart and lungs, and keep people in shape. However, there are certain sports that health professionals consider too dangerous to continue, at least for children. Most of these sports involve a greater risk of serious head or spinal injuries as well as broken bones.\r\n\r\nA children\'s sport that has been gaining popularity over the past few years is youth mixed martial arts, also known as Pankration. This mixed martial arts sport has been called violent and dangerous by opponents. Maryland is among several states that have introduced legislation to address the concerns related to the safety of this sport.\r\n\r\nAlthough rules set forth by the United States Fight League prohibit children under age 16 from hitting opponents in the head, serious injuries can still occur, say leading pediatricians. The director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research says severe trauma can result from the violent actions of this sport. Damage to the neck and spine, including paralysis, are risks. He believes youth MMA should be banned.\r\n\r\nA pediatric sports medicine specialist and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness calls youth MMA troubling due to the potential for permanent disability by concussions and other injuries.\r\n\r\nFor now, it\'s up to parents to decide whether to allow their children to participate in this sport or to put them into something less combative. From a personal injury perspective, the possibility exists for local or national leagues -- or even parents themselves -- being held liable for injuries sustained during the participation of dangerous sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: HLNTV.com, \"<a href=\"http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/02/02/young-mma-fighters\" target=\"_blank\">Kids punch, kick &amp; tackle their way to the top</a>,\" Allison Gilbert, Feb. 2, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Concussions, spinal cord injuries among dangers of youth MMA', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'concussions-spinal-cord-injuries-among-dangers-of-youth-mma', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '', '0', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/?p=910', '0', 'post', '', '0');

Most of these sports involve a greater risk of serious head or spinal injuries as well as broken bones.\r\n\r\nA children\'s sport that has been gaining popularity over the past few years is youth mixed martial arts, also known as Pankration. This mixed martial arts sport has been called violent and dangerous by opponents. Maryland is among several states that have introduced legislation to address the concerns related to the safety of this sport.\r\n\r\nAlthough rules set forth by the United States Fight League prohibit children under age 16 from hitting opponents in the head, serious injuries can still occur, say leading pediatricians. The director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research says severe trauma can result from the violent actions of this sport. Damage to the neck and spine, including paralysis, are risks. He believes youth MMA should be banned.\r\n\r\nA pediatric sports medicine specialist and member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness calls youth MMA troubling due to the potential for permanent disability by concussions and other injuries.\r\n\r\nFor now, it\'s up to parents to decide whether to allow their children to participate in this sport or to put them into something less combative. From a personal injury perspective, the possibility exists for local or national leagues -- or even parents themselves -- being held liable for injuries sustained during the participation of dangerous sports.\r\n\r\n<strong>Source</strong>: HLNTV.com, \"<a href=\"http://www.hlntv.com/article/2013/02/02/young-mma-fighters\" target=\"_blank\">Kids punch, kick &amp; tackle their way to the top</a>,\" Allison Gilbert, Feb. 2, 2013\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Concussions, spinal cord injuries among dangers of youth MMA', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '910-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '2014-02-28 07:51:14', '', '910', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/910-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

At that time, the child’s parents claim that she was left unchecked for close to half an hour after being sedated. The dentist that reportedly performed the procedure worked with a children’s dentistry office, and is accused of making serious medication mistakes that caused the child to go into cardiac arrest. It is also argued that the improper dosage and administration of medications during the procedure caused the child to suffer major brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe pediatric patient was later diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state as a result of brain damage. At that point she was moved into hospice care from a hospital setting.

One dentist is accused of medical malpractice for allegedly failing to prevent and treat complications that resulted in a young patient sustaining severe brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe initial incident occurred in late 2013, when the three-year-old girl in the case underwent a root canal procedure. At that time, the child’s parents claim that she was left unchecked for close to half an hour after being sedated. The dentist that reportedly performed the procedure worked with a children’s dentistry office, and is accused of making serious medication mistakes that caused the child to go into cardiac arrest. It is also argued that the improper dosage and administration of medications during the procedure caused the child to suffer major brain damage.\r\n\r\nThe pediatric patient was later diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state as a result of brain damage. At that point she was moved into hospice care from a hospital setting. Sadly, the little girl recently died.\r\n\r\nThe dentistry practice implicated in the case is apparently closed down; though, the dentist identified as the defendant in the malpractice lawsuit had no comment. The parents of the young victim are accusing the dentist and facility of recklessness and negligence. Their lawsuit claims that the defendant was ill-equipped to handle the medical emergency their daughter experienced.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>CNN, “<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/04/justice/hawaii-girl-dead/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hawaii girl, 3, dies after dental procedure</a>,” Khushbu Shah, Jan. 4, 2014\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Pediatric patient may have been victim of anesthesia error', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '922-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-28 09:36:29', '2014-02-28 09:36:29', '', '922', 'http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/922-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Although, there is no information on what damages, if any, he is seeking in the case.\r\n\r\nThe question may be raised whether the plaintiff’s claims should be addressed to his players’ union or the Major League Baseball association. These accusations come as the baseball player confronts disputes with the baseball commissioner, the MLB, and the MLB Players Association over an impending game suspension.\r\n\r\n<b>Source: </b>thespec.com, “<a href=\"http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/4145402-mlb-a-rod-suing-yankees-team-doctor-new-york-city-hospital-over-pain-agony-distress-/\" target=\"_blank\">MLB: A-Rod suing Yankees team doctor, New York City hospital over \'pain, agony, distress\'</a>,” David B.

At Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, in Hyattsville, Maryland, we bring that knowledge of the law in representing state residents and clients who live in<img class=\"alignright  wp-image-821\" alt=\"i-prac-divorceandseparation\" src=\"http://odelugojohnsonllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/i-prac-divorceandseparation.jpg\" width=\"193\" height=\"253\" /> Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n<p>Divorce is an emotionally-charged legal matter. You and your spouse need to make critical decision related to the family\'s future. We can facilitate that decision-making process and resolve your case through mediation or litigation.</p>\r\n<h3>The Differences in Divorce Law</h3>\r\n<p>Divorce in Washington, D.C., is an easier process. Essentially, the district is a \"no-fault state,\" where divorce can occur after six months of a legal separation. Clients in Maryland face more complexity in lengthier divorce matters. Voluntary separation of one year or mutual separation (also known as limited divorce) of two years is required before a divorce. Instances of adultery, cruelty, abandonment, desertion, constructive desertion, mental illness or incarceration may warrant departure from the requirement.</p>\r\n<h3>Helping Clients Resolve Divorce Matters</h3>\r\n<p>At Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, we have experience with and knowledge of complex areas of the law. We assist clients in the mediation process, particularly when it comes to child custody matters. We also facilitate discussions to determine child support amounts, alimony payments and the division of property in divorce. Whether the setting is the mediation table or the courtroom, we will aggressive advocate for what you are entitled to by law and your rights overall.</p>\r\n<p>Our office is within walking distance from the metro.

What are some common reasons people give you for wanting a divorce?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>One reason, which I hate to say or admit, is spousal cheating. Other reasons are that the parties have grown apart, or one party feels that they’ve done most of the work, they’ve been the primary contributor to the marriage, and they’re tired of one side paying all the bills and contributing and the other side not doing anything.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>When people come to you, do they want to tear the other party up? Or do they want to just end things peacefully?  What happens more often?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>I like the clients that just want to end things peacefully and it appears that when someone is already ready to move on, they may just want to end things.\r\n\r\n[Sometimes, someone has already found someone else, or they’re certain of their decision and they just want to move on.

I spoke to a potential client in Maryland whose only issue was property. They didn’t have any children. He was mad because she didn’t want to be with him. I explained to him that she has the right to choose not to be with him and he’s asking me how can he punish her. I told him there’s nothing he can do to punish her. So he decided not to hire because I didn’t tell him unrealistic things that he could do and, as a result, he hired someone else and he still got the same thing I told him.\r\n\r\n<b>Misconceptions: Annulments</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Well, that makes sense. Okay. Do you ever get asked about annulments? Do you get annulments out the door?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Not many.

You think you could get an annulment, but that’s not true. That’s not even a ground for annulment. It may be in another state – or maybe Vegas – where a certain amount of time has passed, but in Maryland, there has to be certain things, like misrepresentation.

What are some common reasons people give you for wanting a divorce?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>One reason, which I hate to say or admit, is spousal cheating. Other reasons are that the parties have grown apart, or one party feels that they’ve done most of the work, they’ve been the primary contributor to the marriage, and they’re tired of one side paying all the bills and contributing and the other side not doing anything.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>When people come to you, do they want to tear the other party up? Or do they want to just end things peacefully?  What happens more often?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>I like the clients that just want to end things peacefully and it appears that when someone is already ready to move on, they may just want to end things.\r\n\r\n[Sometimes, someone has already found someone else, or they’re certain of their decision and they just want to move on. Some people have left money or they felt somehow victimized during the marriage, like their word didn’t count or their paying didn’t count. They’re trying to prove something. ]\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Say someone wants to be vicious to the other side – will you not take the case or refer this out, or will you handle the case?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>I give them real advice about what they can or cannot do, and if they want to be vicious, I would still take the case, but I would let them know of my limitations. I spoke to a potential client in Maryland whose only issue was property. They didn’t have any children. He was mad because she didn’t want to be with him. I explained to him that she has the right to choose not to be with him and he’s asking me how can he punish her. I told him there’s nothing he can do to punish her. So he decided not to hire because I didn’t tell him unrealistic things that he could do and, as a result, he hired someone else and he still got the same thing I told him.\r\n\r\n<b>Misconceptions: Annulments</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Well, that makes sense.

I know you said this earlier, but it seems like when it comes to divorce, you have to be very prepared. You need to spend time figuring things out, documenting things. Do you do a lot of preparation with clients? What do they have to do in order to get through a divorce successfully and get anything out of it?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Preparation is definitely the key. One thing is if they know that they’d get a divorce, ahead of time, they could research and get the account numbers and know the institutions of their bank, keep track of their money or investments. That they have to know the other side’s assets, the other side’s place of employment, the other side’s income. It’s also important to show the other side’s personality. Emails and correspondence and things like that can be used to show the court if the person’s been kind to you. It’s also important, in terms of children, to show your participation or involvement in the children’s school, using pictures, documentation of sporting events or activities, and talking to teachers.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>That sounds really difficult and extremely personal.

A lot of people don’t like it because everything – all the major things that happened that brought it to this point – is very important.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Do you counsel people to figure things out without litigation? What do you tell people to do? How do they react to this?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes. We always encourage the parties to try to get a settlement agreement because litigation can be very costly. It’s always best for you to decide what’s going to happen with your assets and your children, versus relying on the court to side in your favor. You have no idea which judge you’re going to get and what’s going to happen. So it’s always best to come to an agreement.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>And then people will react when you tell them all the different ways. They have to document what their side of the marriage is. Are they shocked?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Some people were overwhelmed because some people were married for years, decades. Twenty years, thirty years and they literally don’t have all the documentation to prove certain allegations or assertions that they’re making, and other side could not be telling the truth. For instance, one party could’ve paid for the mortgage during the marriage and the other side says, “That’s not true. I made the downpayment or I did this,” and without documentation, it’s harder to prove.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Do you see any bad behavior by people once they go to the divorce process, like they go clean out the bank accounts or they destroy this property? Are there provisions to protect against these bad things happening?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes. They clean out the bank accounts, take retirement money, they lie. They’ll simply say something that’s not true is true. I think that’s the main thing. I mean they lie so much. For instance, when you have two parties saying that they’re the primary caregiver of a child and then they both claim they were the one that pick up the child everyday from school, you know someone’s lying.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Right. Okay. Are there any provisions that can help your client if the other side is having these bad behaviors or they’re trying to take money or they’re trying to invest themselves with assets?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>You can always get a restraining order or injunction. A preliminary injunction restrains the other side from selling the house, destroying assets, or dissipating assets without the court’s permission.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Does that come up often? Is that necessary?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes. It actually happens a lot. Often, one party owns the house and it’s marital property if it was purchased during the marriage because one name is on the house. One party’s name is on the house. The other party can sell the house. So it’s always safe that upon following the litigation that you always ask for a convincibility order in the interim before the divorce to restrain or prohibit them from selling the property or dissipating the assets.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay. Is there other planning that’s needed to get a divorce?

I know you’re not their financial advisor but financially, what do they have to do to prepare? Do you help them with that?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>I don’t usually help people with that aspect. One thing that they can do is notifying a relative and tell them they’re get a divorce. Many people have enough money to leave and it was just cheaper to stay with the spouse but many people are self-supporting.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Do you deal with people who are in the military or are self-employed?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>And is there a different for them if they’re self-employed or they’re in the military?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>It’s easier for a self-employed person to hide their money because they pretty much pay themselves. But doing a divorce when trying to assess a person’s income is kind of hard for a self-employed person. It could be very costly because sometimes if you believe that the person is underreporting their income, you would get a business valuation expert, someone to review their business records, to say how much this business is worth, determine the income and look at expenses because some self-employed people could pay personal expenses from the business account, which would underestimate how much they’re actually earning.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay.

I would say just because one spouse makes more money than the other spouse, that doesn’t mean that they would necessarily get alimony because the court is not looking for them to be equal. You don’t have to be equal. Then the court looks at the party’s standard of living that was established during the marriage. For instance, the husband allowed the wife to sit at home and not work for fifteen years and she doesn’t have skills at this point.

You and your spouse need to make critical decision related to the family\'s future. We can facilitate that decision-making process and resolve your case through mediation or litigation.\r\n<h3>The Differences in Divorce Law</h3>\r\nDivorce in Washington, D.C., is an easier process. Essentially, the district is a \"no-fault state,\" where divorce can occur after six months of a legal separation. Clients in Maryland face more complexity in lengthier divorce matters. Voluntary separation of one year or mutual separation (also known as limited divorce) of two years is required before a divorce. Instances of adultery, cruelty, abandonment, desertion, constructive desertion, mental illness or incarceration may warrant departure from the requirement.\r\n<h3>Helping Clients Resolve Divorce Matters</h3>\r\nAt Odelugo &amp; Johnson, LLC, we have experience with and knowledge of complex areas of the law. We assist clients in the mediation process, particularly when it comes to child custody matters. We also facilitate discussions to determine child support amounts, alimony payments and the division of property in divorce.

Is it called alimony, or is it called substantial support or substantial maintenance?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Well, they’re interchangeable.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay, so we could use all those terms?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>How is that calculated? How does it work?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>The court looks at several factors. One of them is the ability of the party who’s seeking alimony to be self-supporting. I would say just because one spouse makes more money than the other spouse, that doesn’t mean that they would necessarily get alimony because the court is not looking for them to be equal. You don’t have to be equal. Then the court looks at the party’s standard of living that was established during the marriage. For instance, the husband allowed the wife to sit at home and not work for fifteen years and she doesn’t have skills at this point. That’s how he established that he is the primary breadwinner and it may be likely depending on the circumstances that the court would allow that standard of living, if he’s able to support his wife while also supporting himself.\r\n\r\nSo there’s a whole list of factors like age and health, whether the person is of an age where their employability is decreased, whether their health condition maybe makes them unable to work, whether they can seek or obtain sufficient training education in a short period of time that would increase their ability to find suitable employment. The duration of the marriage makes a difference. And I would say one of the big factors that I look at is whether the party who has to pay alimony can afford to pay alimony while still managing their own needs.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Is there a limit that alimony will hit? Or it goes high as it wants to go?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>It just depends on the factors that the court decides are important: need and ability to pay. It can be indefinite or it could be for a period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Interviewer:</strong>  So alimony could be forever for some cases?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes. The duration of the marriage and the health and certain situations, like when someone’s 50-years-old already and they don’t have any skills, then the court could find that they need alimony for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay. What if there’s a situation where one spouse is getting alimony but they just refuse to do anything to get a job or to learn a skill? Can you have it modified or taken away at some point?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson:</b> Yes. But alimony will be either for a period of time where the person gets their education or some type of rehabilitation like rehabilitative alimony.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay.\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>So it depends on the terms or it’s indefinite. Sometimes it’s not really necessary for the other side to fully get back on their feet if enough time has passed. It just depends on what the order says.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>How does this play on the division of assets? Do people trade alimony for assets? Can you do that? Give more assets instead of alimony?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>And vice versa. The award of alimony would also depend on other things the court is going to award, so if we have significant assets and the court is already awarding one party a million dollars in investments and settlement and real property, then there wouldn’t be a need for the court to award alimony.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Okay. I know it depends on the situation, but is there a [path on income] that alimony tends to never to rise above?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>No.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Have you seen 50% of someone’s income, or 70%, or do they just stay in the lower ranges?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>The answer to everything is that it depends, but you are not allowed to garnish someone’s wages. There’s an allowable percentage for child support. And I don’t know that number.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>What’s the typical range or percentage of income they pay?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>It’s not really percentage because it just depends. It depends on your bills or your income, a lot of different factors. I’ve never really analyzed the percentage.\r\n\r\n<b>Interviewer: </b>Has anyone been put in the “poor house” because of it or will the court make sure that you can still live yourself if you only pay what is enough?\r\n\r\n<b>Anitha Johnson: </b>Yes, that’s one of the main factors.
